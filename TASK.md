# Silicon: Tech Tycoon — Build Plan & Progress

Web-stack port of `TECH_TYCOON_PLAN.md` (native SwiftUI → Vite/React/TS + Capacitor).
The game design is unchanged; only the rendering/persistence technology is adapted.

## Phases
- [x] **P0 — Scaffold + handoff docs** (Vite/React/TS, configs, CLAUDE/TASK/LEARNINGS)
- [x] **P1 — Design system** (tokens light/dark + primitives + haptics + toast)
- [x] **P2 — Pure engine** (money, balance, catalogs, product/stats, market, salesCurve,
      economy, competitors, eras) — 38 vitest tests green
- [x] **P3 — Game store** (useGame: compose engine, sim tick, localStorage + offline catch-up)
- [x] **P4 — Parametric device renderer** (deviceStyle, squircle, SVG slab; phone + tablet
      focus, all categories render-ready)
- [x] **P5 — Screens + playable loop** (HQ + iso scene + HUD + nav, Design Lab w/ live preview,
      Research, Market, Company: staff/facilities/financials) + onboarding-lite + bankruptcy
- [ ] **P6 — Balancing pass** (fast-forward harness, tune balance.ts only) — NEXT: early game
      is currently too punishing (low-tier launches can sell ~0 units; reputation drops fast)
- [ ] **P7 — Polish pass** (microinteractions, empty/loading states, hero device idle float)
- [ ] **P8 — PWA manifest + Capacitor iOS scaffold**
- [ ] **P9 — StoreKit/IAP plumbing (Sandbox unlock) — deferred until iOS build**
- [ ] **P10 — Accessibility, perf, store listing**

## v1 scope (keep tight — must feel COMPLETE)
Phone + Tablet playable end-to-end: design → launch → market → reinvest, market sim, staff,
one facility upgrade, financials. Remaining categories are render-ready but gameplay-gated.

## v2 — "Company Evolution" expansion (DONE)
- [x] **V1 — Device overhaul** (#7): front+back 3D flip, realistic thin-bezel front
      (notch/punch/island/none), premium back camera module (concentric-ring lenses + coating
      tint + specular, flash, LiDAR), brand mark, materials sheen. New Product design fields
      (camera count/layout/position/module/flash, notch). Design Lab pickers + live redraw + flip.
- [x] **V2 — Floating gain animations** (#8): rising +$ / +RP tokens (`design/GainFX.tsx`),
      count-up HUD, build progress bars.
- [x] **V3 — Research Points + employees + projects** (#9): RP generated weekly (scaled by era);
      tech unlocks + 6 research projects cost RP; staff assignment (rnd/design/marketing/idle)
      drives function output; weekly XP auto-levels skill; paid training. Project effects wired
      (assembly line / lean supply / qa lab / talent network / brand studio / global dist).
- [x] **V4 — Manufacturing phase** (#10): Design → Build (timed by rnd skill + Assembly Line) →
      Ready shelf → Launch (scored at launch so timing matters). HQ shows In-production progress
      + Ready-to-launch. Garage animates while building/selling.
- [x] **V5 — Balancing** (#11): competition is now a *share multiplier* (never erases a viable
      product); volume floor so shipped products sell something; hype base up; reputation softer.

## v2.1 — staff identities (DONE)
- [x] Each employee has appearance + specialty + trait + mood; effects wired; garage figures +
      roster avatars share one identity; Company roster shows specialty/trait/mood.

## v3 — depth, polish & shipping (DONE this pass)
- [x] **Sound system** (`design/sound.ts`): synthesized Web Audio cues, mutable, wired to taps/
      launch/hit/build/level-up/era/bankrupt + event toasts.
- [x] **Settings** (`screens/Settings.tsx`): theme (System/Light/Dark, persisted via
      `state/settings.ts`), sound + haptics toggles (gated everywhere), Creative/Sandbox unlock
      (unlimited cash), restart-with-confirm, version. Gear in the HUD.
- [x] **Market events** (`engine/events.ts`): periodic viral trends / press / scandal / talent /
      supply crunch / burnout / RP breakthrough — feed + toast + sound.
- [x] **Distinct device silhouettes**: laptop (hinge+deck), tower, monitor+stand, console,
      smartwatch+straps, AR glasses — flip is phone/tablet-only now.
- [x] **IPO win + New Game+ prestige** (`state/legacy.ts`): Go Public at final era + high rep →
      celebration w/ valuation → prestige restart carrying a permanent legacy bonus.

## v3.1 — real-time 3D HQ (DONE)
- [x] **Procedural 3D garage** (`src/garage3d/`, react-three-fiber + drei): lit room, soft
      contact shadows, warm pendant point light, emissive laptops, parallax camera, props +
      animated printer, and **characters built from the same identity** (skin/hair/shirt/
      accessory/mood) with idle typing/head-turn. Zero image assets (all primitives).
- [x] **Safe & optional:** lazy-loaded (three.js stays out of the 103KB initial bundle — it's a
      244KB-gzip chunk loaded only when the 3D HQ shows), SVG `IsoScene` fallback for no-WebGL /
      reduce-motion / toggle-off, **"3D headquarters" Settings toggle**, DPR cap, render paused
      when the page is hidden. Verified premium in light + dark themes.

## v3.2 — office upgrades + hardening (DONE)
- [x] **Office Upgrades** (`engine/upgrades.ts`): 6 cash-bought tiered lines — Workstations
      (+research), Design Suite (+design ceiling & stat), Test Lab (+quality), Marketing Suite
      (+hype), Amenities (+team mood), Assembly (−build time & cost). Wired into every relevant
      selector; Company "Office upgrades" section (pip progress + cost); 3D office gains plants
      as Amenities rise. 42 tests (4 new) green.
- [x] **Audit fixes** (two full-codebase audits): money.format non-finite guard; weeklyRp era
      clamp; persistence try/sanity-fallback + full field backfill; IPO re-show after New Game+;
      no false "level-up" sound on hire; GainFX timeout cleanup; defensive `appearance` default +
      occupants clamp; product-name input aria-label; debounced save (~4s, off the per-tick path).
- NOTE: heavy iterative HMR (50+ hot-updates) can corrupt the dev-server module graph and throw
      a transient `<AppShell>` error — a full reload / `preview_start` fixes it; the build is clean.

## v4 — features, packaging, a11y & tutorial (DONE)
- [x] **Smart auto-naming** (`engine/naming.ts`): `suggestNextName` increments a trailing digit
      run, recognizes number-words (One→Two…twenty, case-preserving) and Roman numerals (IV→V),
      else appends " 2". Design Lab seeds the next draft from the newest product name. 4 tests.
- [x] **Premium price slider** (`design/primitives.tsx` `Slider`): native range, fill track,
      function-accent colour, haptic on change. Replaces +/- price steppers in the Design Lab.
- [x] **Function colour-coding**: engineering=orange, design=green, marketing=blue tokens
      (`tokens.css` `--fn-*`), applied to bottom nav active item, screen titles, Company role/
      assignment chips, the price slider, and the tutorial coach accent.
- [x] **Marketing channels** (`engine/marketing.ts`): launch a built product via a campaign —
      None / Social / Search / Billboards / Influencer / TV / Launch Event — each adds launch hype
      (+ reputation) for a cash cost, gated by affordability. HQ "Market" sheet picks the channel.
- [x] **Office upgrades dual-monitor 3D**: Workstations tier 3+ adds a second laptop; Amenities
      add plants (already shipped in v3.2, reflected in HQ scene).
- [x] **PWA**: `manifest.webmanifest` + parametric `public/icon.svg`, `index.html` meta (installable,
      theme-colour, apple-touch-icon). `capacitor.config.ts` wraps `dist/` for the iOS shell.
- [x] **Guided first-build tutorial** (`components/Coach.tsx`): progress-driven coach card floating
      above the nav — Design → Build → (manufacturing) → Market & launch → done. Reads game state
      (no fragile DOM anchoring), function-coloured per step, dismissible, auto-finishes on first
      launch. Persisted via `tutorialDone`; skipped for New Game+ and backfilled-true for old saves.
- [x] **Accessibility pass**: global `:focus-visible` ring; app-wide `prefers-reduced-motion`
      catch-all (neutralizes coach/gain/shimmer keyframes); `aria-pressed` on all selection chips
      (category/finish/colour/segmented/marketing); `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal` on the Sheet;
      device & iso scenes already expose `role="img"` + descriptive labels.
- [x] **Store listing** (`STORE_LISTING.md`): ASO draft — name/subtitle/keywords, description,
      screenshot plan, pricing + privacy notes. (No real brand/product names — IP rule.)

## v5 — office builder + room polish (DONE)
- [x] **Real garage-startup room** (`garage3d/`): polished-concrete floor with expansion-joint
      seams + painted work-zone, instanced **brick accent wall**, detailed **sectional garage
      door** (panels/insets/window-row/tracks), exposed **ceiling beams** + festoon string lights,
      baseboards, framed window, pegboard w/ tools, whiteboard. New palette materials.
- [x] **Sim speed**: base pace slowed (4s/week) + a **Fast** button (≈6×) beside Pause; HUD shows
      the week number ("Wk 34 · Y1 Q2").
- [x] **Upgrades made physical** in 3D: computers→desk monitors (dual at T2+), marketing→branded
      **wall TV** w/ canvas-drawn company name, amenities→coffee station + plants, design→easel,
      testLab→test chamber. Desks grow from 1 with the team. Company name added (onboarding rename).
- [x] **Interactive office builder** ("Decorate" mode) — the Sims-style ask:
  - `engine/furniture.ts`: 22-item catalog across 9 categories + a **pure grid placement model**
    (footprint, rotation, bounds + overlap checks, world mapping). 6 unit tests.
  - `state`: `layout: PlacedItem[]` + reducers (place/move/rotate/remove/reset) + persistence
    backfill + a tasteful **default furnished room**.
  - `garage3d/furniture3d.tsx`: parametric 3D renderer for every item (zero assets).
  - 3D build mode: overhead camera, **floor grid**, raycast **tap-to-place with snap**, green/red
    **ghost** footprint, tap-to-select → **move/rotate/delete**; furniture always rendered in the
    cozy view too.
  - HQ UI: **Decorate** button, categorized **furniture palette**, edit toolbar, reset.
- [x] **Factory/assembly room-expansion scrapped** (per direction) — office only.
- [x] **Comprehensive catalog + search** — expanded to **56 items across 10 categories**
      (Desks, Seating, Tables, Storage, Lighting, Plants, Decor, Fun, Tech, **Garage**). Modern
      office (standing/dual desks, reception, gaming chair, bean bag, neon sign, art canvas,
      globe, floor clock, sculpture, partition, arc lamp, vending, pool table, foosball,
      treadmill, robot arm, tower PC) + garage (workbench, tool cabinet, tire stack, step ladder,
      oil drum). Each has a hand-modelled parametric renderer. Added a **search bar**
      (`searchFurniture`) that filters across all categories by name/category.

## v6 — builder depth (DONE)
- [x] **Room theming** (`engine/roomStyle.ts`): pick a **floor finish** (Concrete / Wood / Tile /
      Carpet / Polished — each changes colour, seam pattern + sheen) and a **wall style** (Brick /
      Painted / Warm / Concrete / Wood Panel). Theme-aware (dark+light colours). New "Room" tab in
      the builder with live swatch pickers; persisted in `roomStyle`.
- [x] **Builder workflow**: **Duplicate** (drops a copy in the nearest free cell), **Undo** (40-deep
      layout-snapshot history), and a dedicated Reset. New `duplicateFurniture`/`setLayout` reducers.
- [x] **Drag-to-move** (`BuildLayer`): press any piece and drag — it lifts + follows your finger,
      snaps to the grid, with a green/red ghost at the landing cell; release to drop (blocked/off-grid
      → snaps back). Standard r3f pattern (item pointerdown → floor-plane move tracking via event
      propagation → window pointerup commit). Tap = select for the rotate/duplicate/remove toolbar;
      pick from the catalog → tap to place. Replaces the old tap-to-select-then-tap-to-move.

## v7 — comprehensive audit + hardening (DONE)
6-agent parallel audit (engine / state / 3D / UI / balance / code-health). Fixed:
- [x] **Robustness**: top-level **ErrorBoundary** (+ 3D→2D fallback boundary) so nothing white-screens;
      `money.format` extreme-value fallback; `canAdvanceEra` false at final era; `pickEvent` empty-pool
      fallback; `furnitureDef` fallback; `salesCurve` peak-week divide-by-zero guard; `staff.output`
      finite-skill guard (immunizes the whole sim from one corrupt value). +5 robustness tests.
- [x] **Persistence**: backfilled every previously-unguarded field (cash, reputation, cumulativeRevenue,
      week, seed/rngState, facilityTier, researched, launched, lastActive, roomStyle.wall) — old/truncated
      saves can no longer crash the first tick.
- [x] **Save correctness**: fixed-interval save now actually fires during play (was a never-firing debounce);
      `lastActive` stamped on save not per tick (pure reducer + correct offline time); visibility save only
      when hidden; single load+catch-up (no double-load/flash).
- [x] **Sim correctness**: RP/week now applies the Workstations multiplier in the tick (matched the UI).
- [x] **Perf**: `React.memo(FurniturePiece)` + skip-redundant-cell updates (layout no longer re-renders every
      drag-move); **three.js split into its own cacheable chunk** (Garage3D chunk 900KB→234KB).
- [x] **Builder UX**: place-mode taps fall through to the floor (correct cell, no offset); drag snaps back
      when released off-grid.
- [x] **A11y/polish**: `aria-pressed`+labels on assignment chips, furniture tiles, room swatches, theme
      segs; touch targets bumped (HUD 34→40, builder icons 34→40, clear 24→30); live Undo disabled-state;
      `Image` icon aliased; removed dead `.co__upg` CSS.

## v8 — economy + stock market + IPO (DONE)
- [x] **Tighter early economy**: starting cash $50k→$24k; **upfront tooling cost** charged when a build
      starts (`buildCost × 42`, Assembly cuts it) so building is a real bet and a flop loses the tooling;
      sales `floorUnits` 140→70 so flops can't recoup. Engine tests still green (still winnable).
- [x] **Fictional public rivals** (`competitors.ts` roster, IP-safe parodies): **Pomelo** (Apple),
      **Tristar** (Samsung/"three stars"), **Googol** (Google), **NovaPlus** (OnePlus), **Pandacore**
      (Huawei/Xiaomi), **Quantyx** (challenger) — each with a personality blurb, reputation, and a **live
      share price** that evolves weekly (drift + reputation momentum + launch pops + volatility).
- [x] **Stock market** (`engine/stocks.ts` + Market tab): buy/sell rival shares with a 0.8% brokerage,
      per-share price + sparkline + daily % change, your holdings value, and **weekly dividends** from
      held rivals. Trade sheet with quantity stepper + presets + Max + Sell-all.
- [x] **Company IPO + ownership**: live **valuation** (baseline + revenue + reputation), **Go Public**
      once established ($750k lifetime revenue) — sell a 5–49% stake via a slider for a cash infusion and
      keep the rest; **sell more shares** post-IPO (dilution, keeps ≥5%); founder **stake value** + a
      **Net worth** banner (cash + portfolio + stake). New `stocks` unit tests. 61 tests green.
      Verified live: fresh game shows the 6 brands; bought 5 Pomelo @ $940; IPO sold 20% for $2.48M
      → company "publicly traded", 80% owned, "Sell more shares" available. Old saves keep their
      rivals (backfilled with share prices). The ErrorBoundary caught a missing-import mid-build and
      degraded gracefully instead of white-screening — fixed the import.

## v9 — remaining backlog (audit findings not yet actioned)
**Robustness/perf (recommended next):** multi-tab localStorage write-guard (BroadcastChannel) — the only
  real save-loss path on web; split the monolithic game context into state+actions (the 1s tick re-renders
  the whole tree incl. 3D — biggest perf win); `ContactShadows frames={…}` to stop per-frame shadow re-bake;
  share Character geometries; clamp `BrickWall` instance count.
**Balance (need playtesting — flagged, not changed):** early game has no failure pressure ($50k = ~250wk
  runway, founder free, 140-unit floor guarantees profit) → tighten start; flops barely sting → scale floor
  down; era `revToAdvance` is dead (OR with easy rep) → reconsider; RP & training outpace content/cost →
  add sinks; competition is cosmetic (factorK 0.012) → make rivals bite; amenities/veteran-trait under/over-
  powered; launchScore caps flatten late game.
**Depth/content ideas:** recurring revenue/services layer tied to the under-used `ecosystem` stat; production
  capacity tied to assembly; reactive competitors; staff churn/quitting + raises; per-era distinct mechanics;
  mid-life price cuts / product refreshes; more events with player choices; 2D builder entry (currently
  hidden when WebGL is off).
**Polish:** add `--fs-micro`/`--sp-2/6` tokens for the sub-caption sizes + off-grid paddings the audit found;
  Market/feed empty state; Decorate-mode discoverability hint.

## (old) remaining backlog
- Multi-tab localStorage write guard (BroadcastChannel) — surfaces in the preview as the layout
      reverting; harmless in the shipped single-context app.
- Per-item colour/material variants (sofa fabrics, desk wood tones) for finer customization.
- Wall-mounted décor (posters, shelves, neon) with wall snapping.
- Multi-tab localStorage write guard (BroadcastChannel/storage event) — web-only race; surfaces
      in the preview as spurious bankruptcies when two contexts tick the same save.
- Floating gains on *spend* (−$ / −RP) + a celebratory particle burst on a hit launch.
- Animated on-device assembly preview during manufacturing.
- More device customization: button/port placement, two-tone backs, engraving.
- StoreKit/IAP plumbing (Sandbox unlock) — deferred until the iOS build (P9).

## Audit checkpoints
Run the AUDIT PROMPT (see plan §12) after P3 (engine+state) and after P5 (all screens).

## Backlog
_(append out-of-scope improvements here as one-liners; do not act mid-session)_
- [DONE] Early-game valuation rebalanced (cubic reputation curve + $8K base + rev×4): net worth now
  starts ~$13–36K (garage ≈ cash) and grows with real revenue instead of starting at $880K.
- [DONE — verified + pinned v15.2] Engine (PROTECTED): `makeSkills` doesn't guarantee the role's headline discipline is the *highest* — FIXED by the "role-true skills" pass (off-disciplines roll at 35–85% of the primary, strictly below it); now pinned by `engine/staff.test.ts` property tests so it can't regress.
- [DONE — resolved by design in V5/v8] Balance: first-launch flop can yield 0 units sold — the sales volume floor (`floorUnits`, now 70) guarantees any shipped product sells *some* units; flops still lose money on tooling+run (teachable, not brutal, but a real bet).
- Renderer: laptop/desktop/monitor/console/wearable currently reuse the phone "slab" silhouette via the ASPECT map — give them distinct parametric silhouettes (hinge, stand, strap) in the post-core renderer pass (plan Prompt 9).
- Design Lab: gate higher tiers visibly with a "Research in R&D" hint when a component is maxed at current research.
- Multi-tab: localStorage races across tabs (only matters on web, not the Capacitor app) — consider a single-writer guard if shipping a web build.
- Settings screen: theme toggle (data-theme), sound/haptics mute, restart-with-confirm.
- Website (docs/) duplicates the legal/support copy in public/privacy.html + public/support.html; when the policy text changes, update both (or make the in-app copies redirect to the Pages site once it's live).
- [DONE] Vitest 4 `test.poolOptions` deprecation — migrated vitest.config.ts to the top-level
  `fileParallelism: false` (same sequential, flake-free behaviour as the old `singleFork`);
  warning gone, 251 tests pass.
- **POST-LAUNCH DLC candidate #1 — first-class "OS / Platform" division.** The OS economy ALREADY exists in the engine: the `software` component line (BasicOS → Unified OS, catalogs.ts), the `ecosystem` stat, and recurring ecosystem-service revenue (balance.ts `ecosystem.weeklyServiceRate` = unitsSold × ecosystemStat/wk). Today the OS is an invisible *ingredient* inside hardware. The DLC = surface it as a visible feature: a Platform screen showing your released OS, its install base across all your shipped devices, and the licensing $/wk it already earns; plus new levers (license your OS to rivals for a revenue line; OS version releases that lift the whole installed base). This is a framing/UX layer over existing mechanics, NOT a new economy — lower risk than it sounds, but still out of v1 scope (ship first).

## v9 — slower economy + production wizard + smart demand + fanbase (DONE)
- [x] **Much slower base pace**: secondsPerTick 4→8 (Fast button still lets you catch up).
- [x] **Multi-step build wizard** (DesignLab → "Plan production"): Step 1 choose the **production run
      size** (slider + Fans-only / Recommended / Max presets, live pre-order + demand readout);
      Step 2 pick a **marketing campaign**; Step 3 **review** (demand fit, competition, projected
      sales/profit, total upfront). You pay tooling + the WHOLE run + the campaign upfront, so
      over/under-producing is a real bet. HQ "Ready" now just Launches (campaign chosen at build).
- [x] **Fanbase** (`state.fans`): loyal customers who **pre-order** in proportion to how well the
      product fits current demand (`fans × conversion × demandFit`). Hits grow fans (more for big
      sellers + sellouts), flops lose them, gentle weekly decay.
- [x] **Smart demand model** (`planProduction`, pure + 6 tests): total demand = fan pre-orders +
      organic market demand, where organic is cut by a **competition factor** based on how many
      rivals currently ship a product that MATCHES (±12 of your overall) or BEATS you. Sales are
      **capped to the production run** → sellouts (grow fans) vs unsold overstock (write-off).
- [x] Per-unit production cost now paid at build, so launched sales bring full price into cash.
- [x] Tightened competition penalties in balance (match 0.18 / beat 0.42). Vitest single-fork
      config to kill parallel-worker flakiness. **73 tests pass** (incl. new production.test.ts: fans→pre-orders, demand-fit, rival match/beat, run-capping, upfront cost). Fixed a missing balance.competition.matchPenalty/beatPenalty that NaN-cascaded the demand calc. Typecheck clean, build green.

## v10 — premium polish pass (DONE)
- [x] Removed the hard colored `border-left` on HQ upgrade cards (it clipped the rounded corner —
      the reported artifact). Accent now reads via a whisper-thin tinted top border + the glyph +
      level chip + buy button; cards `overflow: hidden` for clean radii.
- [x] Removed cheap neon glows (`box-shadow: 0 0 …`) from upgrade pips + the company-power bar.
- [x] Dropped the coach's clipping `border-left` (accent already carried by its colored glyph + CTA).
- [x] Market feed accent rail → soft rounded `::before` bar (rounded ends, never clips).
- [x] Verified via computed styles: borderLeft 0, soft top accent, no neon. Build + 67 tests green.

## v12 — WASD camera control (DONE)
- [x] The 3D office camera is now drivable: **A/D orbit** around the room, **W/S zoom** in/out,
      **Q/E (or R/F) raise/lower** the eye height — all eased smoothly on top of the existing
      pointer parallax. Keys are ignored while typing in any input, and cleared on window blur.
      A subtle "WASD to look around" hint sits in the scene corner. Typecheck + build green.

## v13 — Kenney CC0 furniture models + catalog expansion (DONE)
- [x] Parametric catalog +10 premium items (executive desk, lounge chair, sectional sofa,
      bar table, wardrobe, monstera, bonsai, floor vase, cube lamp, coffee bar).
- [x] glTF drop-in seam: `src/garage3d/furnitureModels.ts` (registry) + `gltfFurniture.tsx`
      (lazy, BASE_URL-aware). Per-item ErrorBoundary + Suspense fall back to the parametric
      piece if a model is missing/broken — never a blank tile.
- [x] `npm run furniture:fetch` (scripts/fetch-furniture.mjs): self-discovers the current
      Kenney Furniture Kit (CC0) download, extracts, copies 23 matched models to
      public/furniture/<id>.glb. Re-runnable. Synty/paid packs intentionally excluded (license).
- [x] Kenney models are real-world metres → scale:1 correct. 14 load in the default room.
- [x] Fixed corrupted furniture3d import (lazy/Component/Suspense/ReactNode) + dup RoomPalette.
- [x] Fixed vite.config defineConfig import (vite → vitest/config) so `tsc -b` accepts `test`.
- Build green (tsc -b && vite build, 22.1s), scene renders, no console errors.
- TODO (visual tuning, needs eyes-on): per-item yaw/offset for a few Kenney pieces if any face
  the wrong way or sit off-centre — adjust in furnitureModels.ts (scale/yaw/offset fields).

## Backlog — PRE-EXISTING strict-build breakage **[RESOLVED — verified in v14]**
`npm run build` / `npm run typecheck` (= `tsc -b`) was already red before this session — the old
check only ran a no-op stub. `npx vite build` (esbuild) is GREEN, so the shipped bundle is fine;
only the strict TS gate fails. Fixes are additive + mechanical but touch PROTECTED engine/ types,
so they need an explicit go-ahead. Exact errors:
- engine/types.ts `CompetitorState` missing: `sharePrice: number`, `priceHistory: number[]`, `blurb: string`
  → fixes competitors.ts, stocks.ts, Market.tsx, gameState.ts (buy/sellShares), persistence.ts (~16 errs)
- engine/types.ts `Product` missing `plannedUnits?: number`, `channelId?: ChannelId|string`
  `LaunchedProduct` + `BuildJob` missing `plannedUnits?: number`
  → fixes gameState.ts(657,690,692,705), HQ.tsx(148), production.test.ts(67)
- Unused imports to remove: DesignLab `Rocket`; HQ `Sheet`, the all-unused import on line 15,
  `Product`, dead `CHANNEL_ICONS`
- furniture3d.tsx unused `p` param in 3 pre-existing components (lines ~286/509/614) — prefix `_p` or drop
- vite.config.ts `test` key — FIXED this session (defineConfig now imported from "vitest/config")

## v13.1 — Strict-build repair progress **[the "remaining 10" below are RESOLVED — verified in v14]**
Fixed the real PRE-EXISTING engine type bugs that broke `tsc -b` (was ~40 errors → now 10):
- [x] engine/types.ts: `CompetitorState` += `blurb`, `sharePrice`, `priceHistory`;
      `Product`/`BuildJob` += `plannedUnits?`, `channelId?`; `LaunchedProduct` += `plannedUnits?`
- [x] furniture3d.tsx: 3 unused `p` params (WaterCooler/ArtStand/PoolTable) → `_`
Remaining 10 (pre-existing, screen-level — left for a focused, low-risk pass with eyes-on):
- Market.tsx ×4: `format(c.sharePrice)` — sharePrice is cents-as-number, format() wants branded
  Money. Fix: wrap with `cents(...)` (import from engine/money) or type sharePrice as Money.
- HQ.tsx ×4: unused imports — `Sheet`, the line-15 `UPGRADE_LINES` import, `Product`,
  dead `CHANNEL_ICONS` (removing CHANNEL_ICONS may orphan Ban/Share2/Search/Megaphone/Users —
  needs an iterative tsc pass to converge, hence deferred).
- DesignLab.tsx ×1: unused `Rocket` import (one-line removal).
- vite.config.ts ×1: `defineConfig` from "vitest/config" trips a duplicate-vite Plugin type
  clash; needs `dedupe`/cast or moving test cfg to vitest.config.ts.
NOTE: `npx vite build` (the shipped esbuild bundle) is GREEN — these only block the strict
`tsc -b` gate, which was already red before this session (old check ran a no-op stub).

## v14 — reality sync: TASK.md reconciled with the shipped repo (DONE 2026-06-09)
TASK.md had gone stale: ~45 commits landed after v13.1 (merged via PR #1) without doc updates,
including the fixes for everything v13.1 listed as "remaining". Reconciled against the actual
repo state, with every claim below re-verified in a fresh container (`npm ci`):
- [x] **All gates GREEN (verified)**: `tsc -b --noEmit --force` 0 errors (clean, no stale
      tsbuildinfo); vitest **177/177** (14 files); `npm run build` green incl. PWA (sw.js +
      28-entry precache); static smoke of `dist/` via `vite preview` — shell HTML, entry JS/CSS,
      sw.js, manifest all 200. NOT verified here: an in-browser runtime smoke (container has no
      chromium and the playwright CDN is blocked by the network policy) — last recorded live
      smoke is in AUDIT.md Sweep 3/4; unit tests + module-graph-resolving build mitigate.
- **What the undocumented commits delivered** (see `git log` between v13.1 and the PR #1
      merge `c38e327`, plus AUDIT.md):
      audit Sweeps 1–4 (~43 fixes: data-loss/persistence, hype caps, a11y AA, PWA/SW, safe-areas);
      ~30 premium-depth batches (insights, forecasts, lifecycle, achievements, stats, product
      detail w/ "why it won/flopped"); balance passes (Garage-era protection, sharper rivals,
      punishing flops); the late-game arc (Industry Leaderboard #7→#1, era-scaled hit bar,
      escalating prestige/win); Design Lab 4-tab nav; ecosystem revenue + staff churn/raises +
      choice events + rival specialization/price cuts; **IAP plumbing** (`state/iap.ts`,
      simulated on web, 3 marked StoreKit stubs); the full **App Store package** (icon,
      6.7" screenshots, STORE_LISTING.md, BUILD_IOS.md, WHAT_YOU_NEED_TO_DO.md); spend FX.
- **Previously-open items verified as shipped**: v13.1's 10 strict-TS errors; B3 era gating
      (era 2+ now needs rep AND revenue — `eras.ts`); demand-variance forecast **range** in the
      build wizard (no longer a point estimate); spend −$/−RP FX (old backlog line).
- **Still open (verified against source, carried forward)**:
      B5 one-button Suggest price → show a range (deferred design change);
      B6 stock baseline drift still +EV — **FIXED in v15 below**;
      F13 furniture not instanced (only BrickWall is — draw calls scale with decoration);
      AUDIT 0.5 bundle audit (main chunk 541KB / 163KB gzip; three.js correctly split + lazy).

## v15 — B6: mean-reverting stock market (DONE 2026-06-09)
The stock market was a passive income printer: baseline drift (+0.16%/wk) + a CONSTANT
reputation momentum (rival rep never changes after init → pure compounding, up to +0.16%/wk)
+ always-positive launch pops (~+6% every ~7-10wk) + dividends ≈ 40-70%/yr EV for buy-and-hold.
- [x] `competitors.ts`: new exported `fairSharePrice(c)` — the rival's calibrated starting price
      shifted by current-vs-calibrated reputation (`repFairWeight`). Quality is priced into the
      LEVEL (Pomelo $188 vs Quantyx $11), never into a weekly return.
- [x] `evolveShare`: weekly change = `log(fair/price) × meanReversion (0.06)` + launch pop +
      noise. Drift + momentum terms REMOVED. Pops/dips decay (half-life ≈ 12wk) → the Market tab
      becomes a timing game (buy dips / sell pops); buy-and-hold EV ≈ dividends (~5.9%/yr) − fees.
      Corrupt persisted price heals to fair (v7 hardening pattern). −0.95 clamp + 50¢ floor kept.
- [x] `rivalMarketCap` [0.4×, 2.5×] clamp kept as a safety band (comment updated — prices can no
      longer compound out of reach, leaderboard #1 stays seizable).
- [x] 5 new tests (`competitors.test.ts`): fair-value anchoring; 3-seed 400-week zero-EV bound
      (|mean weekly log-return| < 0.002 ≈ ±11%/yr, old printer ≥ +40%/yr); deflation from 3×fair;
      recovery from ⅓×fair; NaN/negative price healing. **182 tests green**, tsc 0, build + PWA ok.
- NOT verified: live-play feel of the Market tab (sparklines now oscillate around fair instead of
      grinding up — flag if it reads "dead"; `meanReversion`/`volatility` are the tuning knobs).

## v15.1 — B5 price band + multi-tab single-writer guard (DONE 2026-06-09)
- [x] **B5 — pricing is a decision again**: new engine `priceGuidance(stats, category)` returns the
      band where priceFit ≥ `guidanceFitFloor` (0.9); the Design Lab shows "Buyers expect $lo–$hi"
      and the one-click **Suggest setter is removed** (the exact peak is never spoiled). The band is
      asymmetric via `overpriceHarshness` (1.45, hoisted from a priceFit literal) so the UI itself
      teaches that overpricing hurts more. Old suggest's hardcoded $9/pt deleted; draft auto-price
      now sources the same helper. Zone pills/slider accent unchanged (relative feedback). 1 test.
- [x] **Multi-tab save guard** (v9 audit "only real save-loss path on web"): `state/tabGuard.ts` —
      every context broadcasts a claim on `silicon.tab.v1` (BroadcastChannel); any OTHER context
      hearing a claim freezes: tick stops AND all 3 save paths (4s autosave, visibility, pagehide)
      check `tabBlockedRef`. Takeover semantics (newest tab plays); frozen tab shows a premium
      `.tabswap` overlay (dialog semantics + focus trap, safe-area, tokens) with "Play here
      instead" → reload → boots from freshest save + claims back. Handoff is near-lossless (the
      old tab saved on visibilitychange). Per-CONTEXT id so StrictMode can't self-freeze; no
      BroadcastChannel → exact pre-guard behaviour (no regression); native single-webview → idle.
      5 tests (Node BC, in-process two-tab sim). **188 tests green**, tsc 0, build + PWA ok.

## v15.2 — engine hardening: determinism pinned + role-true skills pinned (DONE 2026-06-09)
- [x] **AUDIT 1.10 determinism test**: a 160-week cash-boosted run (events, rival launches, trend
      retargets, share prices all exercised) is **bit-for-bit reproducible** from a cloned start —
      full-state deep equality, with only feed ids normalized (they embed the module feedSeq
      counter across in-process runs by design; their per-run uniqueness is asserted instead).
      Guards the whole sim against future Math.random/Date.now leaks. Verified the only wall-clock
      uses in sim paths are intentional (newGame default seed, offline catch-up elapsed time).
- [x] **`engine/staff.test.ts`**: property tests pinning the role-true skills guarantee (40 seeds ×
      3 roles × 10 levels: off-disciplines ≤ primary, strictly below it beyond the tiny-level
      rounding zone; `levelFromSkills` round-trips within ±1). Closes the old PROTECTED-engine
      backlog item as verified-fixed. **191 tests green**, tsc 0, build + PWA ok.
- **Ship status**: repo-side work is DONE per WHAT_YOU_NEED_TO_DO.md — remaining steps are
      owner-side (Apple Developer account, Mac/Xcode build, optional StoreKit wiring at the 3
      `NATIVE INTEGRATION POINT` stubs in `src/state/iap.ts`).
      *(Superseded by the v16 audit below — "repo-side done" was false in several ways.)*

## v16 — ship-readiness audit + fix pass (DONE 2026-06-10)
39-agent verified audit (8 domains, every blocker/major adversarially re-checked against source)
+ a live play-through. 7 commits on `claude/ship-readiness-fixes`:
- [x] **IAP safety (was a guaranteed 2.1 rejection)**: `iapAvailable()`/`NATIVE_IAP_WIRED` seam —
      unwired native builds HIDE the Creative Mode purchase UI, so v1 can submit with or without
      the IAP. Docs fixed: `@capacitor-community/in-app-purchases` does NOT exist on npm (404,
      verified) → cordova-plugin-purchase v13 instructions; "(Optional)" removed from the
      checklist; native-gate regression tests added.
- [x] **Sim no longer ticks during onboarding** (burned ~$390/wk on the name screen; ~13 idle
      min = bankruptcy before founding). Tick + offline catch-up gated on `onboarded`.
- [x] **First-session readability**: coach launch step described a removed flow (campaign moved
      to the wizard); era goal card said "Either threshold" at every era (era 2+ is AND) and
      vanished when ONE bar filled; flop verdict now carries its cause and a flop+sellout launch
      no longer celebrates + punishes in adjacent feed lines.
- [x] **Balance (engine, tested, 197 green incl. determinism pin)**: supply-crunch events capped
      at 35% of cash (RNG can't bankrupt); ecosystem rate 0.0008→0.05 (dead mechanic → real
      annuity); self-cannibalization (`selfPenalty` 0.22 + wizard "Cannibalization" line) kills
      the relaunch-spam dominant strategy; rival entries now dent active products' remaining
      sales curve 10% (`rivalEntrySalesHaircut`) so the threat feed line is mechanically true.
      Knob-tuning (0.22/0.10) needs a playtest; the mechanisms are pinned by tests.
- [x] **Native durability**: save + paid entitlement + prestige mirrored to
      @capacitor/preferences with boot-time restore (WKWebView eviction = the review-bomb risk);
      status bar follows the resolved theme; SW registration actually skips the native shell;
      splash masters generated (resources/splash[-dark].png); v1.0.0.
- [x] **A11y/polish**: `--warning-text` token (closed ~12 hardcoded ambers + AA failures);
      Sparkline per-instance gradient id (red stocks rendered green fills) + chart aria-labels;
      Settings switch names; 40px small-button/coach-skip targets; field user-select + 16px
      import textarea (iOS zoom); crash-screen Reset now confirms; STORE_LISTING no longer
      claims "3D" device renders; Xcode docs REQUIRE portrait-only + iPhone-only.
- [x] **Perf (narrow)**: `React.memo(Garage3D)` + memoized HQ builder + narrowed staff snapshot
      (per-tick R3F re-reconcile gone when nothing visible changed); ContactShadows re-bake key
      includes positions/rotations/desks (moved furniture kept stale shadows); WebGL2 probe
      (three r163+ dropped WebGL1 — old check crashed into the ErrorBoundary); AudioContext
      pointerdown warm-up + resumes from iOS "interrupted".

### v16 — deferred (logged, not done)
- Full state/actions context split (the complete F36) — the memo pass above captures most of the
  win; the split is still right long-term.
- Furniture instancing (F13), GPU-tier quality scaling, keep-HQ-mounted canvas reuse.
- rem-based type / iOS Dynamic Type; iPad layout (v1 ships iPhone-only, documented).
- More choice events (only 4, one-shot, replay verbatim in NG+) + era-4-only decisions; NG+
  variety beyond bigger numbers; component sidegrades (always-top-tier is still dominant);
  Creative Mode content beyond the cash floor (thin for $2.99).
- Owner-side (Mac): `npx cap add ios`, Xcode portrait/iPhone-only settings, StoreKit wiring if
  the IAP ships in v1, on-device smoke (Preferences mirror, status bar, haptics).

## v17 — full audit + iOS/CI pipeline made shippable (DONE 2026-06-10)
4 parallel domain agents + a CI/native deep-dive on a green tree (tsc 0, vitest 199→**201**, build+PWA ok).
- [x] **iOS TestFlight workflow rewritten to actually work.** It was archive-only (never uploaded) and its
      `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` injection was a no-op (the `grep -q` guard matched the team already in the *Debug*
      config, so the `sed` was skipped and *Release* — what `archive` uses — had no team → signing failed).
      Now: build → cap sync → archive (ASC API-key cloud signing) → export `app-store-connect` IPA → upload
      via altool, team/signing passed as `xcodebuild` args, secret preflight, run-number build number.
- [x] **Removed the corrupt `ios-testflight.yml`** (invalid YAML — no indentation + literal markdown fences).
- [x] **Added the missing shared `App.xcscheme`** (Windows-generated project never had one;
      `xcodebuild -scheme App` would have failed) + `ios/ExportOptions.plist`.
- [x] **Capacitor stack aligned** `@capacitor/cli` 8.4.0→6.2.1 (was a major skew vs core/ios/plugins 6.2.1).
- [x] **`Package.swift` fixed**: Windows `\` paths → POSIX, and the **missing `CapacitorPreferences`** plugin
      (used by `nativeStore.ts`) added. (`cap sync` self-heals it on the runner; the committed file is now
      correct for a manual Xcode open too.)
- [x] **`Info.plist`/pbxproj match the locked ship target**: `armv7`→`arm64`; portrait-only; iPad orientation
      block dropped; `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` `"1,2"`→`"1"`; Release `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` set;
      `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` "iPhone Developer"→"Apple Development".
- [x] **Engine**: offline catch-up was **silently skipping ~half of every selling product's revenue** (the
      one untested code path) — fixed to half-speed time; `startBuild` maxRun clamp; `migrate` launched-field
      guards; `deviceStyle` blank-render fallback. +2 tests.
- [x] **UI**: defined the missing `--sp-5/10/14` spacing tokens (app-wide spacing was silently collapsing —
      RULE #1); replaced glyphs `◎ ★ › → ✓` with Lucide.
- **Owner action for the workflow:** add three repo secrets — `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`,
  `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64` (base64 of the `.p8`). The team ID is
  already wired (S3U8B8HH96). Without them the run fails fast with a clear message.

### v17.1 — offline & import correctness (DONE 2026-06-10)
- [x] **Sandbox entitlement re-validated on load** (`entitlements.withValidatedSandbox`, wired into
      useGame boot + import): an imported/older save with `sandboxUnlocked:true` no longer unlocks the
      unlimited-cash floor on a device that doesn't own the IAP. +1 test.
- [x] **Staff no longer quit during offline catch-up** (gated the churn roll on `!offline`, `!offline`
      first so the active-path RNG stream is unchanged) — an irreversible loss you couldn't react to;
      at-risk staff can still quit on the next online tick. +1 multi-seed test (offline never drops an
      at-risk member; online does — proving the contrast).
- [x] **Stale event reschedule**: catch-up pushes `nextEventWeek` forward if it slipped into the past,
      so an event no longer fires the instant you return. +1 test. (204 tests; tsc 0; build+PWA ok.)

## v17.2 — cosmetic polish sweep (DONE 2026-06-10)
Verified each flagged site against source first (several audit findings were stale/wrong — see below).
- [x] **Rank-1 leaderboard medal dark-mode contrast**: was a translucent amber tint + `#b8860b` text →
      dark-on-dark in dark theme. Now a solid `--mat-gold` chip + new `--gold-ink` token (opaque, reads
      in both themes), mirroring the `--me` rank chip's solid treatment.
- [x] **Removed dead `.lab__price-btn`** (the old +/- price stepper; price is a Slider now).
- [x] **`.co__proj-wk` 8px → `--fs-nano` (10px)** — was below the legible floor on-device.
- [x] **HQ insights keyed by `ins.text`, not array index** — the set is recomputed/sliced per tick, so
      index keys caused stale DOM/animation. (Fixed-position pip + forecast-bar lists keep index keys.)
- [x] **Tokenized coach.css exact-match literals** (`13px`→`--fs-caption`, `8px 12px`→`--sp-8/--sp-12`,
      `2px`→`--sp-2`) — appearance-preserving RULE-#1 cleanup.
- Stale findings (already correct — left untouched): the "WASD" hint is **already** gated off touch
  (`hq.css`: `display:none` + `@media (hover:hover) and (pointer:fine)`); `.lab__price-display` is **in
  use** (the live price readout), not dead; EmptyState passes only Lucide glyphs so `.ds-empty__glyph`
  `font-size` is inert (harmless, left).
- Deliberately NOT changed (reflow/appearance risk without on-device eyes): 9px micro-badges
  (`lab__chip-gen`, market) — acceptable micro-type; `coach__title` 14px / `gainfx__tok` 15px (no
  matching token); the soft `→` arrows in `App.tsx`/`HQ.tsx` labels (typographic, low value).

## v17.3 — backlog cleared: state robustness + 3D correctness + engine nits (DONE 2026-06-11)
Worked the remaining v17 audit backlog. 206 tests (+2), tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Tick announcements fire once per simulated week** (`announcedWeekRef` gate): toasts +
      achievement announces ran inside the `setState` updater, which React invokes twice under
      StrictMode → double toasts in dev. Unlocks still fold into state on every invocation; only the
      announce is gated. `withLiveAchievements` (launch path) documented as value-call-only.
- [x] **Frozen tabs can recover** (`tabGuard` release protocol): the PLAYING context broadcasts
      `release` on pagehide (frozen tabs never do — closing a stale tab can't steal play); a frozen
      tab that's currently visible reloads into the freshest save, a hidden one keeps the overlay
      CTA. `releaseNow()` test seam (+2 node BC tests incl. the 3-tab no-steal case).
- [x] **One `persistNow()`** replaces the three drifting copies of the save call (interval /
      visibility / pagehide).
- [x] **Engine:** `nextWeekRevenue` now sums full price (production prepaid at build — runway/forecast
      read low while selling); ecosystem revenue reads the freshly-updated `launched` (was 1-wk lag);
      `newGame`/`migrate` seeds unsigned (`>>>0`; migrate's Date-based fallback collapsed toward few
      values from float overflow).
- [x] **3D:** robot model seam made truthful + the dead `tint` path is now LIVE — `robot_shared.glb`
      (rename the committed inactive sample) is tinted per ROBOT_COLORS slot, per-colour files keep
      native colours; parametric robot stays the shipped default (zero visual change today).
      ROBOT_COLORS single-sourced in robotModels.ts. Roamer #5+ fan out on a golden-angle spiral
      around the 4 homes (no more stacked/jittering pairs). Context loss now toasts + exits Decorate
      cleanly (was a silent swap that stranded editor state). `prefers-reduced-motion` is live —
      flipping it mid-session downgrades 3D→IsoScene without a reload (was mount-time only).
- [x] **Micro-type on-scale:** 9px badges → `--fs-nano` (designLab chip-gen, market stage badges);
      `coach__title` → `--fs-caption`; `gainfx__tok` → new `--fs-fx` token (15px, deliberate).
- **Stale audit findings verified NOT bugs** (documented, untouched): competitors decay/presence
  thresholds agree in practice (entries ≤1 are deleted the tick they decay — sub-1 strength never
  persists); staff #17+ "invisible" — the render cap (16) equals the Campus staffCapacity cap (16);
  CameraRig's settle comment claims only what it does (skips camera writes, not whole-scene battery).

## v17.4 — first REAL on-device pass (TestFlight screenshots) (DONE 2026-06-11)
The TestFlight pipeline went live this session (Admin ASC key + tolerant .p8 decode + app record);
build 11 reached a real iPhone. Four on-device screenshots drove this pass — all four findings were
invisible in the container and real on the phone. 206 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Branded icon + splash shipped** (was the stock Capacitor logo on device): gen-icons.mjs now
      writes the native AppIcon (opaque) + Splash imageset directly — no forgettable second step.
- [x] **Splash can't strand the app**: launchAutoHide:true (2s cap) as the OS-level net + boot's
      native-restore raced against 1.2s so a stalled bridge can't block first paint.
- [x] **Onboarding keyboard**: own scroll layer + top safe-area fade (content jammed into the
      Dynamic Island when the keyboard opened); brand-name field drops autocorrect/QuickType,
      Enter founds.
- [x] **HUD**: chips/buttons wrap as groups (was an arbitrary mid-group split on iPhone width);
      cash + label turn negative with "Nwk left" under 4 weeks of runway (the below-fold pills
      were the only warning — a player at $1.2K/8 staff saw a calm HUD).
- [x] **3D office**: Kanban label re-anchored over its board (collided with the Whiteboard pill);
      OfficeLabel type onto --fs-micro/--fs-nano, scene-constant colours lifted to named consts.
- [x] **Research**: "Battery · +16 Battery" → "Battery · +16" (single-stat dedupe).
- Flagged, not changed (design call): the 4 always-on fixture labels (Whiteboard/Kanban/Vault/
  Gate) label static objects forever — restraint says fade them after first view or show on tap;
  staff labels carry live data and should stay. Needs the owner's eyes on-device.

## v18 — upgrades feel like SOMETHING + lens counts are earned (DONE 2026-06-11)
Direct user ask: "upgrades should be exciting / feel like you're actually doing something; device
features like lens count should be RP unlocks." 210 tests (+4), tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Upgrade celebration**: new `upgrade` sfx (mechanical thunk → rising sparkle → chord);
      bought card blooms (accent ring + radial wash), the new tier pip ignites (overshoot pop),
      the effect line rises out of the card; facility moves celebrate too. Research component/
      project buys (previously DEAD silent) share the cue + success haptic. Reduced-motion safe.
- [x] **The feed says what appeared in the 3D room** per tier (coffee station, wall screen,
      easel, test chamber, second monitors) — purchases visibly change the world they own.
- [x] **RP-gated lens counts** (`state.lensLimit`, `unlockLens`, `lensUnlockCosts {3:14, 4:30}`):
      stepper caps at the unlocked count; an inline "Unlock triple-lens module · 14 RP" buy in the
      Camera tab steps straight onto the new lens (live render payoff). Old saves backfilled to the
      highest count they actually used. Counts 1–2 free; grandfathered drafts never downgraded.
- NOT verified on-device: sound character + animation timing need ears/eyes (tuning knobs:
  sound.ts upgrade case, hq.css keyframes). Knob costs (14/30 RP) need a playtest.
- Backlog seed: the unlock seam generalizes — notch styles / module shapes / finishes as
  research unlocks if the lens gate lands well.

## v19 — garage declutter, Bank popup, gated upgrades, Rest (DONE 2026-06-11)
User ask: bare-garage start, whiteboard/TV as upgrades, tap-employee menu, research-masked
upgrades, vault→bank money popup, "extremely easy to understand." Decisions locked via
AskUserQuestion: **foundation first** (3D taps deferred to an on-device follow-up), tap **opens
the roster card**, **Rest is a real mechanic**. 214 tests (+8), tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Bare-garage start**: removed Kanban wall + security gate (starter clutter) + labels;
      **Whiteboard now appears only with Workstations (computers ≥ 1)** — earned, not pre-placed.
      TV was already Marketing-gated (confirmed). Down to Bank + (earned) Whiteboard + live staff labels.
- [x] **Bank popup** (`components/Bank.tsx`): tap the HUD cash → a clean, bold finances screen —
      hero cash + weekly in/out + runway, Net Worth broken into cash + your-company stake + rival
      shares, Research points as the 2nd currency, lifetime earned. The vault is relabelled "Bank";
      the 3D vault-tap entry point is the deferred follow-up (HUD entry ships + is testable now).
- [x] **Research-gated masked upgrades**: Marketing (Brand Agency+) and Assembly (Robotic Line+)
      top tiers LOCK behind Brand Studio / Vertical Integration research — rendered masked-grey with
      a lock + "Research X to unlock Y". Engine enforces the gate too. `UpgradeLine.requires` +
      `upgradeLockedBy` — extensible to more lines.
- [x] **Rest mechanic**: paid time off (one week's salary) → +30 mood + clears the burnout counter;
      distinct from Raise (permanent). In the roster only when useful (mood<50 / danger), urgent red
      when about to quit. Free for the unpaid founder.
- **Deferred (on-device follow-up — chosen "foundation first"):** the 3D taps — tap employee →
      open their roster card (Train/Assign/Raise/Rest live there now); tap the office Vault → open
      the Bank. Both reuse the proven furniture tap-select raycast; unverifiable in CI.
- NOT verified on-device: Bank layout polish, masked-card contrast, Rest button thresholds —
      flag anything off. Gate mapping (which tiers/projects) + Rest cost/boost (1wk / +30) need a playtest.

## v19.1 — roster polish + 3D taps wired (DONE 2026-06-11)
- [x] **Roster-card premium pass** (user-requested audit): verdict = already premium (token-driven,
      soft surface-2 + hairline, smooth mood/skill/xp bars, 12px rhythm). Fixed the two real flaws —
      the Rest button crammed a sub-label inside the pill (wrapped/broke the pill on narrow phones →
      now clean "Rest · $X", explanation in a title) and a pre-existing DUPLICATE `.co__member-contrib`
      rule (consolidated to one).
- [x] **3D taps wired** (the deferred follow-up): tap a seated employee → Company roster (invisible
      transparent hitbox over desk+robot); tap the Vault → Bank popup. `onTapStaff`/`onTapBank` through
      Garage3D→Scene, `onNavigate`/`onOpenBank` through HQ→OfficeScene. Gated to non-Decorate mode.
      **NOT CI-verifiable — 3D tap hit-testing needs an on-device check** (does the tap register over
      the parallax camera? does the vault wrap-group catch child-mesh taps?). Reuses the BuildLayer
      raycast pattern, so the approach is proven; the wiring is new.
- Still nice-to-have: tapping an employee navigates to Company but doesn't yet scroll/highlight THAT
  person's card (just opens the roster). Add a focus-id hand-off if the tap lands well on-device.

## v19.2 — premium finishes are earned (RP-unlocked + meaningful) (DONE 2026-06-11)
Continues the user's "device upgrades with research points" vision (lenses → finishes). 216 tests
(+2), tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **titanium / gold finishes RP-unlocked** (12 / 26 RP); plastic + aluminium stay free. Design
      Lab Style tab masks locked finishes (lock + dim) with an inline "Unlock {Finish} · N RP" buy
      that unlocks + selects + plays the upgrade fanfare. `finishLimit` + `unlockFinish` /
      `finishUnlockCost` mirror the lens seam; `FINISH_ORDER` is the canonical ladder.
- [x] **They DO something** (not just cosmetic): premium finishes add a small Design-appeal bonus
      (titanium +2, gold +4) in the STATE layer (`productStats`), NOT the protected engine
      computeStats — so launched products keep their snapshot stats; zero retroactive balance ripple.
- [x] Old saves backfill `finishLimit` to the highest finish their products already use.
- NOT verified on-device: the locked-chip look + unlock-button placement. Bonus magnitudes
  (+2/+4) and costs (12/26) need a playtest.
- Backlog seed (unchanged): notch styles / camera module shapes could follow the same seam, but
  they're purely cosmetic — only worth gating if the finish gate feels good first.

## v19.3 — one R&D hub: device unlocks surfaced on Research (DONE 2026-06-11)
The progression spine (lenses / finishes / projects / component tiers) had drifted across 3 screens.
- [x] **Research leads with a "Design unlocks" card** showing both device tracks (camera lenses +
      premium finishes): what each does + a buy button (or Maxed ✓), reusing unlockLens/unlockFinish
      + the upgrade fanfare. Hides once both maxed. Design Lab keeps its point-of-use inline buys.
      Now RP reads as ONE economy (assign R&D → earn RP → unlock device tech / component tiers /
      projects, all in one place). UI-only; engine actions already tested. 216 tests, tsc 0, build ok.
- NOT verified on-device: the card's look + placement among the other Research cards.

## v19.4 — Marketing Push: a 2nd mid-life lever (cash vs margin) (DONE 2026-06-11)
Found the price-cut/refresh mechanic already existed (well-built, one cut per product, caps at the
production run). Added its missing sibling so the post-launch decision has a real trade-off.
- [x] **Marketing Push** (`marketingPush` + pure `marketingPushQuote`): spend cash to lift a live
      product's remaining weekly demand (capped at plannedUnits → clears genuine surplus only),
      KEEPING price. Cost = 35% of the extra revenue unlocked; +30% demand boost. One per product.
      Price cut (no cash, lower margin) vs Push (full price, cash now) = a real cash-vs-margin call.
- [x] Surfaced in the product detail sheet beside the price cut (reuses the `.pd__pricecut` visual
      language, Megaphone icon). Only shown when surplus exists. Cash-spend FX wired. +3 tests (218).
- NOT verified on-device: the two intervention blocks stacked in the sheet — check they read
  clearly as distinct options. Boost/costPct (30% / 35%) need a playtest.

## v19.5 — on-device fixes from the first TestFlight playthrough (DONE 2026-06-11)
Four issues reported live from PR #6's build; all fixed, 218 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Sheets wouldn't close (IMG_0140)**: the grab handle was decorative; only the thin scrim
      strip closed a sheet → felt trapped. Handle is now a real control — **tap or drag-down to
      dismiss** (snaps back under threshold). In the shared `Sheet` primitive → every popup gets it.
- [x] **Locked components showed "T2" (IMG_0139)**: the Components picker now names the **next
      tier** you'd unlock + its stat gain ("🔒 TurboCore A2 · +24 Perf · research in R&D"), accent
      name — aspiration, not a dry number.
- [x] **Design flow unclear (IMG_0142)**: added a **sticky Back / Next step bar** above the tab nav
      (gray Back left, green "Next: <step>" right); click-through except the buttons; Next hides on
      Launch (its own Build CTA). Fixed-position offset clears the tab bar — **needs an on-device px tune**.
- [x] **3D fell back to 2D permanently (IMG_0138)**: `webglcontextlost` → sticky `glLost` stranded
      the player in 2D until app relaunch. Added a **"Try 3D again"** pill on the fallback that
      remounts the Canvas. Likely a device GPU context-loss (recent work *reduces* 3D load, so
      unlikely my regression) — this makes it recoverable in-session rather than fixing a root cause
      I can't repro. **Open question for the user: is it every launch or intermittent? did relaunch fix it?**

## v19.6 — exploit/bug audit + smoothness (DONE 2026-06-11)
"Make it clean & smooth; look for exploits and bugs." Audited the money/economy surfaces.
- [x] **Exploit fixed — free Rest**: founder (s0) has $0 salary, so Rest cost $0 → unlimited free
      morale (≈ permanent free output). `restCost = max(salary, BALANCE.churn.restMinCost=$1000)`.
      Rest is now always a real spend. +1 test.
- [x] **Bug fixed — Coach/step-nav overlap**: the new Design step nav (fixed, z29/bottom60) sat in
      the same band as the first-build Coach card (z28/bottom72), buttons rendering over it. Nav now
      gated on `state.tutorialDone` (they never coexist; Coach guides during the tutorial).
- [x] **Audited clean (no action needed):** offline catch-up (week-capped, clock-backward = no-op);
      stock trades (two-sided fee → no same-week round-trip; oversell/insufficient-cash clamped);
      builds (cash-guarded, no cancel/refund path); giveRaise (founder-excluded + no-op at market →
      no mood farm); prestige (gated behind IPO win, full reset → legacy can't be farmed); bankruptcy
      (post-mortem + restart, no soft-lock). 219 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.

## v19.7 — money-flicker fix + UI polish (DONE 2026-06-12)
On-device screenshots: cash flickered negative↔positive every tick; floating gains sat on the
speed controls; finishing a design had no closure; the boosts list scrolled forever.
- [x] **Bug fixed — headline cash flickering negative**: `AnimatedMoney` tweened with a bitwise
      `| 0`, which coerces to a signed 32-bit int. Cash is integer **cents**, so any balance above
      ~$21.47M (cents > 2^31) overflowed mid-count-up and wrapped negative — the headline visibly
      flipped −/+ on every weekly tick. Switched to `Math.trunc`; interrupted tweens now resume from
      the on-screen value (no backward jump). The ONLY money-bitwise in the app (grep-verified).
- [x] **Floating gain tokens off the controls**: `+$ / +RP` tokens were pinned top-right over the
      pause/fast-forward/settings buttons. Anchored under the cash headline on the left.
- [x] **Design-complete sheet**: finishing a build only flashed a toast + silently reset the draft.
      Now a celebratory sheet shows the finished device + forecast, a "manufacturing → launch from
      HQ" next-steps panel, and a "Track in HQ" CTA that navigates there.
- [x] **Active boosts compacted**: ~19 completed projects rendered as two-line rows = endless
      scroll. Now a wrapped chip cloud (effect on `title`) with a "Details" expander.
- [x] tsc 0, 219 tests green, build + PWA green.

## v20 — Scenario mode (retention Wave 1a) (DONE 2026-06-19)
The retention backbone from RETENTION_ROADMAP.md (competitor research: RollerCoaster Tycoon +
Two Point Hospital — scenarios with tiered 1–3★ win conditions are what carry tycoon replayability,
and they're fully offline/server-free). Built engine-first across 3 commits; 291 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Engine** (`engine/scenarios.ts`, PURE + 13 tests): `Scenario` = authored start overrides
      (era/cash/reputation/fans) + `[1★,2★,3★]` tiers, each an AND of `Objective`s that read ONLY
      data the engine already tracks (cumulativeRevenue/netWorth/reputation/fans/productsShipped/
      hits/era). Pure evaluators + a `deriveScenarioFacts(state)` adapter (mirrors achievements.ts).
      6-scenario catalog spanning the curve (First Light → Bootstrapped → Head Start → Underdog →
      The Long Game → Empire). A tier-monotonicity property test pins that a higher star can never
      be easier than a lower one.
- [x] **State** (`state/gameState.ts` + `scenarioProgress.ts`, +9 tests): `activeScenario` per-run
      tag (+persistence backfill → null for old saves); `newScenarioGame(id)` applies the setup over
      `newGame` and skips onboarding/coach; `scenarioResultFor(state)` selector. Best-stars-per-
      scenario live in a PROFILE store (separate localStorage key, mirrored to native Preferences +
      added to MIRROR_KEYS for durability) so mastery survives restarts/NG+. The tick records a new
      best + one celebratory toast in the same once-per-week gate as achievements (idempotent write).
- [x] **UI**: `ScenariosSheet` (premium card list — difficulty chip, the three tiers, earned stars,
      confirm-before-overwrite Play) reached from a Scenarios row in Company (mirrors Achievements);
      `ScenarioTracker` on HQ shows the next unmet tier's objectives with live progress bars + a
      closure banner on 3★ mastery / failed deadline. `useGame.startScenario(id)` (does NOT inherit
      prestige legacy — scenarios are a level playing field). Tokens + 8pt grid (RULE #1).
- **NOT verified on-device**: card/tracker layout + the confirm overlay; scenario target balance
      (the objective thresholds + Underdog's wk-78 deadline) needs a playtest — flag anything off.
- [x] **Onboarding entry** (follow-up done): "Or take on a scenario" link on the first-run screen.
- **Deferred (follow-up, logged)**: scenario setup overrides for rivals/trends/forced-category
      (would touch protected competitor/trend init — a separate pass).

## v20.1 — Wave 1b: shareable result cards (DONE 2026-06-19)
The only "community surface" available without a backend (per RETENTION_ROADMAP §6/Wave 1b);
also delivers the deferred celebratory win moment. tsc 0, 291 tests, build+PWA green.
- [x] `components/ResultCard.tsx` — a premium, screenshot-worthy SVG/token card (zero image assets:
      parametric CircuitBoard brand glyph): company name, scenario name + stars (or "{Era} empire"),
      4 headline stats (lifetime revenue / net worth / products / fans), wordmark + week. Offers a
      `navigator.share` TEXT summary where supported (progressive enhancement — deliberately NOT a
      canvas→PNG rasterizer, which would be fragile + need on-device verification; the universal
      share is the OS screenshot, and a "Screenshot this card" hint says so).
- [x] Surfaced from the HQ `ScenarioTracker`: a "View result card" button appears once the player
      has earned any star; mastery (3★) and failed-deadline closure banners cleaned up alongside.
- NOT verified on-device: card layout as an actual screenshot; navigator.share behaviour on iOS.

## v20.2 — Wave 1c (partial): choice-event variety (DONE 2026-06-19)
- [x] `engine/events.ts` CHOICE_EVENTS 13 → 22 (purely additive content; no logic change). 3 era-1
      (public beta / founder burnout / viral meme), 3 era-2 (green pledge / retailer ultimatum /
      counterfeit surge), 3 era-3 (privacy reckoning / moonshot lab / talent raid). Reuses existing
      EventEffect kinds + era-consistent magnitudes → resolveChoice + balance untouched; the picker
      already avoids repeats within a run, so more events = more run-to-run variety (attacks the
      GDT "solved/verbatim replay" failure mode). events pool-drain test now covers all 22.
- **Wave 1c remaining — NEEDS A GO-AHEAD**: component sidegrades (cheaper-but-lower / battery-vs-
      perf tiers so the optimal recipe isn't a fixed ladder) touch PROTECTED engine (product.ts /
      catalogs.ts / balance) + need a balance pass — not done without explicit instruction.
## v22 — Wave 3: Platform / OS division DLC (Phase A+B) (DONE 2026-06-19)
DLC #1 per DLC_OS_PLATFORM.md — surfaces the OS economy that already runs invisibly (software line
+ ecosystem stat + recurring ecosystem-service revenue) as a first-class, gated division. Engine→
state→UI; 325 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Engine** (`engine/platform.ts`, PURE + 6 tests): `installedBase`, `osTier` (software level →
      tier name), `canReleaseVersion`, `osReleaseReward` (bounded, hard-capped fan bonus — the
      "no free faucet" guard from spec §5). `BALANCE.platform` constants.
- [x] **State** (+5 tests): `platformUnlocked` (DLC gate), `osName`, `osVersion` (+persistence
      backfill + newGame defaults). Selectors `platformInstalledBase` / `osTierInfo` / `osDisplayName`
      / `canReleaseOsVersion`; actions `unlockPlatform` / `setOsName` / `releaseOsVersion`. Licensing
      revenue is the EXISTING `weeklyEcosystemRevenue`, reframed (no formula duplication → no drift).
- [x] **UI**: `PlatformSheet` (name your OS, tier, installed base, licensing $/wk, version + a
      release-version "launch day" button) — gated, reached from a Platform row in Company (shown
      only when unlocked). Settings → Expansions → a "Platform Division" unlock switch (entitlement
      gate; real IAP purchase wiring deferred like the existing sandbox stub).
- **Phase B** (version release) is a one-time, BOUNDED rep/fan moment tied to advancing the Software
      research tier — deliberately NOT a recurring rate change, so the tuned economy is undisturbed.
- **NOT verified on-device**: Platform sheet layout; release reward magnitudes (4 rep / 2k+capped
      fans) need a playtest.

## v22.1 — Wave 3 Phase C: license your OS to rivals (DONE 2026-06-19)
The platform trade-off — reach & revenue vs. a sharper competitor. 329 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Engine** (+2 tests): `rivalLicenseFee(rivalRep, osTier)` — bounded, hard-capped weekly fee;
      `licenseeStrengthUplift()`. `rivalStrengthsFor` gains an optional `{licenseeIds, uplift}` so a
      licensee competes harder in shared categories (backward-compatible — plain reads unchanged).
- [x] **State** (+2 tests): `osLicensees` field (+backfill); `weeklyLicenseFees` selector;
      `licenseOsToRival` / `revokeOsLicense` actions (gated on unlock + a real rival, idempotent).
      Fees collected weekly in the tick (rate-scaled, next to ecosystem revenue); the licensee uplift
      is applied in `planProduction` (the single competition point) — so the fee genuinely makes
      that rival tougher on your launches. Balance: fee `$1.5k + rep×tier×$40`, capped `$250k/wk`;
      uplift +8 strength. **Magnitudes need a playtest** (flagged).
- [x] **UI**: PlatformSheet "License your OS" section — every rival with its weekly fee + a
      License/Revoke button + the explicit reach-vs-rivalry warning.

## v21 — Wave 2: daily/weekly challenges (DONE 2026-06-19)
The offline Mini Motorways model (date-seeded, no backend/leaderboard). Built engine→state→UI; 310 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Engine** (`engine/challenges.ts`, PURE + 13 tests): a challenge = freeform start + date-seeded
      MUTATORS + a scored "best <metric> by week N" goal. MUTATORS catalog (start-condition twists
      expressible via the existing newGame path — cash mult / reputation / fans); UTC date helpers
      (dateKeyOf, mondayOf), FNV-1a hashSeed, dailyChallenge / weeklyChallenge (Monday-anchored,
      2–3 distinct mutators, longer run); formatScore / scoreMetricLabel. Same date → identical
      challenge for every offline player.
- [x] **State** (+8 tests): `activeChallenge` + `challengeScore` (+persistence backfill); `newChallengeGame`
      applies mutators as start overrides; `withChallengeScore` locks the score snapshot at scoreWeek
      (pure, idempotent; folded into the tick + boot/offline like evaluateAndUnlock); `challengeViewFor`
      selector; per-date personal-best store (`challengeProgress.ts`, native-mirrored) — the offline
      "beat your own history" substitute for the server leaderboard. `useGame.startChallenge(kind)`;
      tick records best + one toast on the score-lock transition.
- [x] **UI**: `ChallengesSheet` (today's daily + this week's weekly, mutators, personal best,
      confirm-before-overwrite) from a Challenges row in Company; `ChallengeTracker` on HQ (goal,
      live score, weeks left, locked final + best banner). Reuses the scenarios card language.
- **NOT verified on-device**: card/tracker layout; mutator balance + the 52/104-week score windows
      need a playtest. **Deferred**: deeper sim-level mutators (no-marketing / fixed-price / recession)
      need BALANCE-override plumbing (a larger change); a one-attempt-per-day LOCK (today you can
      replay a date's challenge — single-player, no leaderboard to protect, so low priority).
- **Next**: Wave 3 OS/Platform DLC (DLC_OS_PLATFORM.md); Wave 1c component sidegrades (PROTECTED
      engine — needs a go-ahead); the NG+/mastery + content-cadence items in RETENTION_ROADMAP Wave 4.

## v23.2 — Wave 4: Founder Perks + AI-Era content (DONE 2026-06-19)
- [x] **Founder Perks** (`engine/perks.ts`, PURE +tests): NG+ "beyond bigger numbers" — a 6-perk
      ladder unlocked one-per-prestige, derived purely from the persisted `legacy` level (no new
      store). Bounded effects (design ceiling / launch hype / weekly RP) applied via the existing
      STATE-layer selectors (designTierCeiling / hypeBonus / weeklyRpGen) — protected engine
      untouched. NG+ win overlay previews the next perk.
- [x] **AI-Era (era 4) content**: 7 era-4 market events + 3 era-4 choice dilemmas (AI ethics, the
      moonshot race, training-data consent) — the endgame had NO era-specific events/decisions before
      (it reused the era-1–3 pool). Additive content, era-appropriate magnitudes.
- **Era-distinct *mechanics* (different RULES per era) remains a deliberately-deferred large item**:
      it would reshape the tuned per-era economy and needs a playtest. The event/choice flavour above
      is the safe slice; true mechanic divergence is flagged, not built.
- **Wave 4 remaining (open, low priority)**: run-history "this week in tech" recap (the live feed
      already serves this — likely redundant); deeper era mechanics (above).

## v23 — Wave 4: Device Museum (cross-run collection meta-progression) (DONE 2026-06-19)
The "new thinking" headline from RETENTION_ROADMAP §3 — leans into the pillars (devices are
parametric SVG, "the product is the toy"): every device you ship is enshrined in a permanent,
browsable museum that PERSISTS across New Game+ and restarts. Retention via collection, not
engagement-farming. 333 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- [x] **Profile store** (`state/museum.ts`, +1 test file): newest-first, capped at 60, de-duped by
      key, corruption-tolerant, native-mirrored (added to MIRROR_KEYS). Stores the renderable
      Product + name/category/era/company/week/verdict.
- [x] **Recorded on launch** (useGame.launchReadyCb) — each shipped device is enshrined the moment
      it launches (keyed by seed+productId+week, so re-runs don't collide).
- [x] **UI** (`screens/Museum.tsx`): a 2-col gallery re-rendering each device via DeviceRenderer
      (zero assets) with name/category/era/company/verdict; premium empty state. Reached from a
      Device Museum row in Company (always available).
- **NOT verified on-device**: gallery layout + DeviceRenderer at 120px thumb size.
- **Wave 4 remaining (open)**: NG+/mastery depth beyond bigger numbers; era-distinct mechanics;
      run-history "this week in tech" headlines; bankruptcy post-mortem share card. RETENTION_ROADMAP
      Wave 4 + the "new thinking" list track these.

### v17 Backlog — still open (need on-device eyes / a design call)
**3D/perf:** `frameloop="demand"` + `invalidate()` retrofit (battery; a wrong conversion silently
  freezes the scene — do with eyes on the office); furniture instancing (F13, draw calls scale with
  decoration); route the deliberate "intrinsic object colours" in `furniture3d.tsx`/`Garage3D.tsx`
  through `RoomPalette` for light-theme harmony (visual tuning); context-loss auto-RESTORE (current:
  clean fallback + toast; no path back to 3D without remount).
**Screens (cosmetic, low value):** inert icon-container `font-size`s on now-SVG glyphs; broader
  hardcoded-px tokenization across screen CSS; soft `→` arrows in `App.tsx`/`HQ.tsx` labels
  (typographic — debatable vs the Lucide rule).
**Larger projects (logged earlier, unchanged):** full state/actions context split (F36); rem-based
  type / Dynamic Type; iPad layout; more choice events / NG+ variety / component sidegrades.

## v24 — post-launch depth: market segments + living rivals (Epic A + B1) (DONE 2026-06-22)
The first post-launch feature chapter (v1.0 is live). Built from `EXPANSION_ROADMAP.md` (a fresh
2024–2026 competitor research pass). Owner authorized Epics A + B. Engine-first, backward-compatible,
405 tests green, tsc 0, build+PWA ok.

### Epic A — Market Segments (the demand-model second axis) — COMPLETE end-to-end
The market is split into five buyer segments, each weighting the five stats AND price differently;
a launch wins a SHARE OF EACH segment, summed — so "who is this for?" is a real positioning decision
(the strike at the genre's solved-recipe failure: GDT/Mad Games Tycoon).
- [x] **Engine** (`engine/segments.ts`, PURE +9 tests): `SEGMENTS` (Budget/Mainstream/Pro/Style/
      Enterprise); `segmentEffectiveWeights` (segment taste × category emphasis × global-trend tilt —
      trend-drift still matters); `segmentFit`; `segmentPriceFit` (per-segment elasticity); `segmentDemand`
      → per-segment breakdown + `demandIndex` + `effectivePriceFit` (drop-in analogs) + dominant/weakest.
      `balance.ts` gains an additive `market.segments` block (trendInfluence, minPriceTolerance).
- [x] **Integration** (`market.ts` PROTECTED, additive: optional `demandOverride`/`priceFitOverride` on
      scoreLaunch — omitted = identical pre-segments behaviour; `gameState.planProduction` feeds the two
      aggregates; `ProductionPlan.segments`; `launchReady` records dominant/weakest/per-segment in the
      launch insight). Balance preserved: a balanced product's demandIndex averages back to the old
      single-trend demand, so era thresholds / verdict bands / maiden-launch fairness are unchanged
      (full suite green). Lopsided products diverge — that IS the new depth. `types.ts` SegmentId +
      LaunchInsight optional fields. +3 production integration tests.
- [x] **UI**: DesignLab wizard "Who it's for" bars (which segment each design wins, best-fit accented);
      Market post-launch "Audience" driver ("strongest with Pro; weakest with Budget — priced out").
- NOT verified on-device: segment-bar layout; live economic FEEL of lopsided builds needs a playtest
      (mechanism pinned by tests; segment weights/sizes in segments.ts are the tuning knobs).

### Epic B — Living Rivals (phase B1: rivals ship real products) — visibility layer COMPLETE
Rivals were invisible "strength" emitters; now each launch is a real, renderable device you can see
and learn from (fix for Computer Tycoon's "rivals are just a color on the map").
- [x] **Engine** (`engine/rivalAI.ts`, PURE +7 tests): `generateRivalProduct` builds a full Product
      (era-gated tiers, finish, camera, price, original name) whose quality tracks launch strength and
      whose style/margin follow the rival's tone (premium/value/balanced from competitors.ts identity).
- [x] **State** (`gameState.rivalReleases`, capped 24, newest-first; persistence backfill): the tick
      converts each rival launch into a RivalRelease via a DERIVED rng (seeded from save+week+index) so
      the MAIN sim rng stream stays byte-identical — determinism pin + all seed tests unchanged. Feed
      lines name the device. +2 integration tests.
- [x] **UI**: Market "Rival releases" card — each rival device via DeviceRenderer (zero assets) with
      name/category/price/tone tag.
- NOT verified on-device: Rival releases card layout.
### Epic B — Living Rivals (phases B2 + B3) — COMPLETE (v25, 2026-06-23)
- [x] **B2 — reactive doctrines** (`competitors.ts`): RivalDef.isLead → `doctrine`
      (defender/trendChaser/undercutter/generalist) + `rivalDoctrine()`. A trend-chaser piles
      category-selection weight onto the player's hot cats; a defender adds strength + cadence (the old
      lead numbers, unchanged); an undercutter ships an aggressively cheap product (`contested` flag on
      CompetitorLaunch + a visible price slash via rivalAI) and presses cadence — never raw strength,
      so the contested ceiling + winnability are preserved (300-week cap guard test). Feed reads
      "Pandacore X undercuts your Phone"; Market shows an "undercut" badge. +6 tests.
- [x] **B3 — M&A + new entrants** (`competitors.ts` CHALLENGER_POOL + spawnChallenger; `gameState`
      acquireRival/canAcquire/acquisitionCost; `state.acquiredRivals`). Buy out a rival (cost = market
      cap × premium − your existing stake), removing it + absorbing its brand (+rep) and customers
      (+fans, capped); gated on established + a field floor. The tick refills a thinned field with a
      fresh challenger — rng drawn ONLY on that branch, so a normal game's determinism is byte-identical.
      UI: Market TradeSheet "Acquire" action (two-tap confirm, self-explaining gate). +5 tests.
- NOT verified on-device: Acquire control + undercut badge layout.
- **Epic B fully shipped** (B1 visible products → B2 doctrines → B3 M&A). 416 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA.

### Epics A + B — next possible chapters (open)
- Segment playtest-tuning pass (weights/sizes/trendInfluence) once felt on device.
- Per-segment SIZES could drift over time / by era (a Pro-heavy AI era), making positioning dynamic.
- Rival mortality (organic exits via a rival-fortune signal) — deferred; B3's player-driven removal +
      entrants already keeps the field churning.
- Acquired-rival synergies (inherit their preferred categories as a launch bonus); M&A achievements.

## v26 — Epic C: the Verdict Layer (readability moat) (DONE 2026-06-23)
The H1 "make it legible" bet from EXPANSION_ROADMAP §4 — cheapest, lowest-risk, most review-quotable,
and it amplifies the Epic A segments. Engine-first, additive. 428 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA.
- [x] **C2 — converging pre-launch forecast** (`engine/forecast.ts`, pure +6 tests): forecastConfidence
      (marketer skill + Demand Sensing, capped) → forecastBand (base→floor, monotone, never above the
      no-knowledge band). The wizard band uses it AND the realized launch variance is remapped into the
      same band (gameState.launchReady), so a tighter forecast is HONEST. Wizard shows a
      "Forecast confidence: Low/Med/High" row. baseBand mirrors demandVariance (no-knowledge = old ±12%).
- [x] **C1 — first-class ranked post-mortem** (`engine/postmortem.ts`, pure +6 tests): scores how
      decisive each factor was (demand/price/competition/hype/audience), ranks them, writes a synthesized
      headline (segment-aware via Epic A's perSegment). Market ProductDetailSheet orders drivers by
      impact, flags the 2–3 "key factor"s, dims the rest, and leads with the headline. Falls back to the
      plain list for pre-insight saves.
- NOT verified on-device: post-mortem headline + forecast row layout.
- **Remaining:** C3 — plain-language explainers ("what it does and who wants it") for every
      stat/component/segment (Two Point "almost nothing is confusing"). Lower leverage; open.

### Roadmap status after v26
Shipped: A (segments), B (living rivals), C1+C2 (verdict layer). Open H1/H2/H3 epics:
C3 (explainers), D (era-distinct mechanics — PROTECTED, needs playtest), E (delegation/ops),
F (reactive audio + a11y), G1 (form→demand, needs A — now unblocked), G2 (surface synergy),
G3 (new categories/era DLC). Next-best by leverage: G2 (cheap, UI over existing synergy math) or
F (premium feel/a11y); G1 is now unblocked by segments.

## v27 — Epic G: deepen the design toy (G1 + G2) (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **G2 — surface component synergy** (DesignLab, pure UI over existing componentSynergy): the live
      view now shows a two-sided "Build" readout — "Flagship +6%" / "Balanced" / "Weak: Battery" — with
      a one-line explanation that names the bottleneck OR celebrates the coherent-build bonus (the
      Kairosoft combo "aha", pillar #5). No engine change.
- [x] **G1 — form affects demand** (`engine/aesthetics.ts`, pure +5 tests): styleAppeal(product) turns
      the previously-inert render choices (notch, camera module/layout coherence, flash) into a bounded
      0..8 bonus that lifts the Style segment's fit ONLY (segmentDemand optional param, default 0 →
      backward compatible; +2 segment tests). finish/designTier/refresh are NOT re-counted (already in
      the design stat). planProduction passes it; the DesignLab live breakdown now runs through the SAME
      segment model as the wizard/launch (fixes a post-Epic-A inconsistency where live "Fit" was the old
      single-trend score) and shows a "Design language: Striking/Clean/Plain/Dated" readout.
- NOT verified on-device: design-language readout + the live feel of the style weighting (playtest).
- **Remaining:** G3 — new categories / a new era past AI as content drops (renderer already supports
      the silhouettes; gameplay-gated). Data in catalogs.ts; S each.

### Roadmap status after v27
Shipped: A (segments), B (living rivals), C1+C2 (verdict layer), G1+G2 (design toy). Open:
C3 (plain-language explainers), D (era-distinct mechanics — PROTECTED, playtest-heavy),
E (delegation/ops), F (reactive audio + a11y), G3 (new categories/era DLC).
Next-best by leverage: F (premium feel/a11y — earns the price, dodges "rip-off" reviews) or
E (delegation — touch-critical for late-game scale). D is highest playtest cost; G3 is content cadence.

## v28 — Epic F: premium feel — accessibility slice (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **High-contrast mode** (`state/settings.ts` highContrast pref + applyContrast; `design/tokens.css`
      [data-contrast="high"] overrides for light AND dark — near-ink muted text, visible hairlines/strokes,
      --focus-width 2→3px; `index.css` focus ring reads the token; Settings "High contrast" toggle).
      Purely additive — off by default, scoped to the root attribute, default experience byte-identical.
      Base theme already clears WCAG AA (text variants, reduced-motion, focus rings); this serves
      low-vision users beyond AA. 435 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA.
- **DEFERRED (need on-device/audio session):** F reactive-audio palette + per-action microinteractions
      (can't be heard/felt headless; RULE #1 = don't ship polish rough). Colorblind-safe palette swap
      also deferred (the app already pairs tone with icons/labels; a full red/green remap risks the
      function-colour identity — do it with eyes on device).

### Roadmap status after v28
Shipped: A (segments), B (living rivals), C1+C2 (verdict layer), G1+G2 (design toy), F-a11y (high contrast).
Open: C3 (explainers), D (era-distinct mechanics — PROTECTED, playtest-heavy), E (delegation/ops),
F-audio + F-microinteractions (on-device), G3 (new categories/era DLC).
STRONG RECOMMENDATION: an on-device playtest of the A→B→C→G stack before more balance-sensitive work —
a lot has landed engine-side (segments reshape demand, rivals, forecast, style→demand) without on-device
validation of FEEL. Next buildable-blind epic: E (delegation, low-risk, touch-critical) or C3 (explainers).

## v29 — Epic E: delegation & ops (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Delegation** (`gameState.ts` pure policies +7 tests `state/ops.test.ts`): canAutoAssign /
      canAutoResearch (gated on a senior staffer / senior engineer, BALANCE.ops.leadSkill=5);
      autoAssignIdle (idle → role discipline via ROLE_ASSIGNMENT); autoClaimResearch (cheapest
      affordable in-era project via buyProject — can't exceed player capability); applyWeeklyAutomation
      runs the enabled+capable ones at the top of advanceOneWeek. setAutomation action; state.automation
      persisted + backfilled. OFF by default → determinism byte-identical (all prior tests unaffected).
      Company "Delegation" card: two gated toggles with self-explaining lock states. useGame wired.
- NOT verified on-device: delegation card layout.
- **Future (bigger, deferred):** auto-reorder production runs + a design-lead spec drafter — both touch
      cash/launch decisions, so they need their own balance pass + on-device validation.

### Roadmap status after v29
Shipped: A, B, C1+C2, G1+G2, F-a11y, E (delegation). Open: C3 (explainers), D (era-distinct mechanics —
PROTECTED, playtest-heavy), F-audio + F-microinteractions (on-device), G3 (new categories/era DLC),
E-future (auto-reorder / design lead). Next blind-buildable: C3 (explainers, low-risk UI) or G3 (content).
STILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND an on-device playtest of the A→B→C→G→E stack before the balance-heavy D.

## v30 — Epic C3: plain-language explainers → Epic C complete (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Glossary** (`engine/glossary.ts`, pure +4 tests): STAT_INFO (plain-language for all 5 stats);
      segmentTopStats / segmentPriceLabel / segmentWants(ById) — DERIVED from live SEGMENTS weights, so
      copy can't drift from the sim. "Who it's for" rows now show a "what this buyer wants" line
      ("Performance + Quality · price-insensitive"). 446 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA.
- **Epic C COMPLETE**: C1 (ranked post-mortem) + C2 (converging forecast) + C3 (explainers).

### Roadmap status after v30
Shipped: A, B, C (full), E, G1+G2, F-a11y. Open: D (era-distinct mechanics — PROTECTED, playtest-heavy),
F-audio + F-microinteractions (on-device), G3 (new categories/era DLC), E-future (auto-reorder/design lead).
Most remaining work either needs on-device validation (D feel, F audio/feel) or is content cadence (G3).

## v31 — Epic D: era-distinct mechanics (first slice) (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **eraModifiers** (`balance.ts` table + `engine/eras.ts` eraModifier/eraRuleSummary, +4 tests):
      marketingHype / ecosystemRate / demandVariance per era, routed through EXISTING selectors (no new
      system). Eras 1-2 = 1.0 baseline → early game byte-identical (all prior tests pass). Era 3 Platform
      = ecosystem lock-in (services + marketing up); Era 4 AI = hype-driven + volatile (variance up).
      Wired: weeklyEcosystemRevenue (both sites), planProduction marketing hype, launchReady variance
      band; DesignLab live + wizard previews scale identically (honest forecast per era). advanceEra
      announces the shift in the feed. +2 production tests (Platform eco rev > Garage; late-era hype up).
- ⚠️ **WIRING tested + safe; late-era MAGNITUDES need a playtest** (isolated in balance.eraModifiers).
- **Future D:** a genuinely new axis/mechanic per era (a new stat in the AI era; retail/supply in Growth)
      rather than multipliers — bigger, needs design + playtest.

### Roadmap status after v31
Shipped: A, B, C (full), D (first slice), E, G1+G2, F-a11y. Open: F-audio + F-microinteractions
(on-device only), G3 (new categories/era content), E-future, D-future. The blind-buildable roadmap is
essentially DONE — what remains needs on-device validation (audio/feel, balance magnitudes) or is content.
STRONGLY RECOMMEND a playtest now: the late-era D magnitudes + the whole A→B→C→G→E→D stack want real eyes.

## v32 — OS legibility tweak + Franchises (bigger feature) (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **OS income total** (Platform.tsx): the headline stat now sums BOTH recurring streams (ecosystem
      services + rival licensing) instead of showing services alone — with a breakdown hint. Fixes the
      under-read of the division's worth + the "Licensing income"/"License your OS" word overlap.
- [x] **Product Franchises / Brand Equity** (NEW bigger feature — `engine/franchise.ts` pure +7 tests):
      a product LINE (sequels sharing a name, built on naming.ts) accrues brand equity from its track
      record (verdict-weighted, recency-decayed, capped). A proven line launches with loyal pre-orders
      (×up to +40%) + anticipation hype (≤+0.15); a flop tarnishes it. First-in-line → equity 0 → zero
      bonus (additive; all prior tests pass). planProduction.brand exposed; DesignLab wizard shows a
      brand-equity readout ("Aurora line · Established"); live preview adds the same hype for consistency.
      +2 production tests (a hit line beats a fresh name; a different name doesn't inherit equity).
      ⚠️ preorder/hype caps are a launch-economy lever — flagged for playtest.
- Emoji audit: confirmed the app is emoji-free (Lucide icons throughout); only typographic ★/→ in
  star-ratings + comments. The preview HTML now uses inline SVG icons (no emoji).
- 463 tests green, typecheck 0, build+PWA.

### Backlog (logged, not acted — outside task scope)
- OS feature: a per-licensee fee tooltip; an installed-base trend sparkline. Minor legibility.
- Franchises: an explicit "name this line" affordance + a Franchises overview (lines + their equity)
  in Market/Company; brand-equity decay on a long lapse (currently only recency-weighted by entry).

## v33 — Franchises overview + rival company profiles (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Rivals build real series** (`rivalAI.ts`): a stable flagship line per rival+category
      (rivalLineName, deterministic) + a series number from prior releases → "Pomelo Lumen" → "… 2" → …
      generateRivalProduct takes seriesIndex; gameState derives it. Determinism + rival stat tests hold.
- [x] **Franchise aggregation** (`franchise.ts`, +2 tests): playerFranchises (group launches into lines
      with equity, deepest first) + rivalLines (group a rival's releases + avg quality) + franchiseDisplayName.
- [x] **UI** (Market.tsx): "Your franchises" card (per line: brand-equity tag + units + latest + equity
      bar). Rival releases are now TAPPABLE → RivalProfileSheet: company card (reputation, market cap,
      share, strategy/doctrine) + their product lines + recent releases + a Trade-shares jump.
- 465 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA. preview.html updated (franchises + rival profile).
- Backlog: an explicit "name this line" affordance in DesignLab; franchise revenue totals; surface
      a rival's licensee/acquisition status in the profile.

## v34 — Continue-a-line sequels + rival-profile sparkline/acquire (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Continue a line** (DesignLab "Name & build"): one-tap chips that name the draft as the next
      entry in an existing line (suggestNextName of the latest) + inherit its brand equity; same-category
      lines first; equity tag on each chip. Surfaces the franchise loop where you name a product.
- [x] **Rival profile depth** (Market RivalProfileSheet): a share-price Sparkline + change %, and an
      Acquire action (two-tap confirm + self-explaining gate) right in the company card. Reuses
      canAcquire/acquisitionCost/acquireRival (tested).
- UI-only over tested engine fns. 465 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA. preview.html updated.

## v35 — Franchise revenue + rival relationship status (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Franchise revenue** (`franchise.ts` FranchiseSummary.revenue = sum of revenueToDate; shown in
      "Your franchises"). Test updated.
- [x] **Rival relationship status** (RivalProfileSheet): "Licenses <YourOS> · $X/wk" badge when the
      rival licenses your OS, and "You own N shares · X%" when you hold their stock (the buyout-discount
      stake). Reuses rivalLicenseFee/osTierInfo/holdings.
- 465 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA. preview.html updated. Franchise chapter complete.

## v36 — OS division deepened: feature modules + device coupling (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Sheet bug fix**: bottom sheets now portal to `<body>` (primitives.tsx) so the trailing action
      (e.g. Platform → "Done") clears the fixed tab bar instead of being trapped beneath it. Also drops
      the unintended screen card-stagger fade the scrim was inheriting.
- [x] **OS feature modules** (`engine/platform.ts` OS_FEATURES): 6 researchable capabilities (App
      Marketplace, Cloud Sync, On-Device Assistant, Privacy Suite, Health Hub, Cross-Device Continuity),
      each gated behind an OS version + an RP cost. `osEcosystemBonus` + `osServicesMultiplier` (both
      bounded; caps + per-version step in `balance.platform.features`).
- [x] **Real lever** (user's call): a built module lifts the ecosystem stat of every device you launch
      (via `productStats`, state layer — `product.ts` untouched) AND multiplies recurring services income
      (selector + tick). Exactly 1.0× / +0 when the division is off → base economy byte-identical.
- [x] **State**: `osFeatures: string[]` (+persistence backfill, resets on NG+ like research, entitlement
      carries); `installOsFeature` gated on entitlement+version+RP; `osFeatureList`/`osEcoBonus`/
      `canInstallFeature` selectors; exposed via useGame.
- [x] **UI**: Platform "OS features" card (build/locked/built/unaffordable states, effect readout);
      Design Lab review note "Runs <OS> vN · +X ecosystem from N modules".
- 477 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green. preview-os-features.html sent.
- ⚠️ Balance magnitudes (module RP costs, ecoBonus/servicesMult, caps) NOT playtested on device — all
      isolated in `balance.platform.features` + the OS_FEATURES catalog for a one-file tuning pass.

## v37 — OS division: more modules, achievements, completion celebration (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Two more modules → 8 total**: Wallet & Pay (v2), Media Studio (v3). `ecoBonusCap` 20→26 so a
      FULL build (+25 ecosystem) pays in full — the completion reward — while still bounding the sum.
- [x] **Achievements**: "Platform Pioneer" (first module) + "Walled Garden" (every module). New pure
      facts `osFeaturesBuilt`/`osComplete` (0/false until the division is unlocked). `installOsFeature`
      routed through `withLiveAchievements` + the RP-spend FX so they fire the instant you build.
- [x] **Dopamine**: live build-progress bar on the OS features card (N/total → "Complete"); sound +
      haptic + RP-spend FX per build; and a bespoke portal "Platform complete" celebration on the final
      build — spring-in emblem, radiating ray burst, sealing check, global confetti, the platform totals.
      Pure vector; ray/spring choreography fully disabled under reduced motion.
- 481 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green. preview sent.
- ⚠️ Still NOT playtested on device: a fully-built OS adds +25 ecosystem to every launch (intentional
      late-game power, gated behind all 8 modules + OS v4 + ~408 RP). Tunable in one file if too strong.

## v38 — Celebration system + OS depth (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Reusable `Celebration` overlay** (design/Celebration.tsx + celebration.css): generalized the
      OS-complete moment — portal, ray-burst emblem, sealing check, stat chips, confetti + sound on
      mount, accent/positive tone. Reduced-motion safe. OS-complete refactored onto it.
- [x] **(b) OS version release celebration**: launch-day beat (new version, +fans, +reputation, devices
      updated); reward captured at click so it survives the card swap.
- [x] **(a) New Game+ legacy celebration**: confirming prestige opens a positive-tone "Legacy N forged"
      moment (crown emblem, the inherited cash/rep/fans/RP + founder perk); its confirm founds the next
      run. The reset reads as a reward, not a wipe.
- [x] **OS reach sparkline**: tick samples installed base weekly while unlocked (capped 40, backfilled);
      Platform shows an "OS reach" Sparkline + "+N this period" trend.
- [x] **3 OS achievements**: Going Mainstream (100k base), Ubiquitous (1M), Kingmaker (3 licensees).
- 485 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green. preview-os-celebrations.html sent.
- Backlog (logged from the v38 survey, not acted): franchise line-naming + gallery UI; Research RP-sink
      feedback card; Challenge weekly recap + milestones; per-licensee relationship/churn; OS module
      synergies; Market feed empty state; Museum device-story blurbs.

## v39 — Content drop: events, franchise detail, OS synergies (DONE 2026-06-23)
- Survey finding: several "backlog" items were ALREADY built — Design Lab "Continue a line" chips,
  Market "Your franchises" card (revenue/equity/entries), and the Market feed empty state all exist.
  So this drop added the genuinely-missing pieces instead of rebuilding them.
- [x] **+9 market events, +4 choice dilemmas** across all eras (engine/events.ts) — additive flavour
      using existing effect kinds, no state-layer changes; invariant tests cover them.
- [x] **Franchise detail sheet**: tapping a line in Market opens its "chapters" — every product newest
      first with a parametric device thumbnail, verdict, units + revenue, and the line's lifetime totals.
- [x] **OS module synergies**: pair complementary modules for an extra services bonus (One-Tap Commerce,
      Seamless Handoff, Proactive Wellbeing). Folds into osServicesMultiplier (still capped); surfaced as
      a "Synergies" subsection (active vs locked). 4 new engine specs.
- 489 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- ⚠️ Synergy + module + version services bonuses now reach ~2.56× at a full v5 build (cap 2.6) — close
      to the rail; if more is added later, raise servicesMultCap. NOT playtested on device.

## v40 — Research income legibility + OS customization & licensee churn (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Research income card** (lowest-risk pick): read-only breakdown of weekly RP by source (founder
      trickle + each R&D staffer) with mini bars. Pure rpSources(staff,era) engine helper (sum pinned to
      weeklyRp by test) + weeklyRpSources(s) selector (sum == weeklyRpGen). No balance/persistence change.
- [x] **OS philosophy** (customizable + unique): pick one lasting identity that tilts every launch +
      services — Curated Garden (+eco), Open Platform (+services), Performance-First (+perf), Privacy-First
      (+quality). Bounded via productStats + osServicesMult (re-capped). osPhilosophy state (backfilled
      null; resets on NG+), setOsPhilosophy (gated, tap-to-clear), 2-up picker card.
- [x] **Licensee relationships + churn**: per-licensee satisfaction (osLicenseeHealth) that decays with
      your reputation lead and can churn (they drop the license) once low. Pure updateLicenseeRelations +
      licenseeMood (balance platform.licenseeChurn). Tick advances it live-only (never offline). Platform
      shows a relationship bar + mood per licensee. Seeded on license, pruned on revoke + acquisition.
- 505 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- ⚠️ Churn magnitudes (dominanceFreeGap 12, decay 0.7/pt, threshold 28, churn 14%/wk) NOT playtested —
      all in balance.platform.licenseeChurn. Philosophy +5 stat / +20% services likewise untuned on device.
- Note: the signing server returned intermittent 503s this session; commits succeeded on retry.

## v41 — Found the OS division as an earned milestone (DONE 2026-06-23)
- [x] **Founding cost**: the Platform division is now a major in-game reinvestment you save up for
      (balance.platform.foundingCost = $250k), not a free Settings toggle. Discoverable "Found the
      Platform division — $X" card on Company with an affordability state; founding deducts cash, brings
      the division live, and fires the shared Celebration. foundPlatform reducer + canFoundPlatform /
      platformFoundingCost selectors; useGame value-call path (spend FX + achievements).
- [x] The free unlock moved to Creative-mode overrides in Settings (only shown while Sandbox is on),
      so normal play earns it; Sandbox's cash floor keeps creative experimentation free. Existing
      founded saves untouched (no retroactive charge).
- 506 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green.
- ⚠️ $250k founding cost NOT playtested on device — tune in balance.platform.foundingCost. It's a
      base-game cash gate now (not the old DLC-toggle scaffold); flag if you'd rather keep it DLC-gated.

## v42 — progressive-disclosure gating: a day-one garage isn't buried (DONE 2026-06-24)
Kicked off by a "take it to the next level — smoothness, clarity, players understand what to do"
ask + 4 parallel research audits (3 competitor sweeps: Game Dev Tycoon / Mad Games Tycoon 2 /
Software Inc / Computer Tycoon / Startup Company / Capitalism Lab / Two Point / Kairosoft / FM
Mobile / Egg Inc; + 1 code-grounded internal clarity audit). **Unanimous finding: the game is
unusually legible PER-SCREEN; the gap is STRUCTURAL DISCLOSURE — advanced systems are present
from day one instead of introduced when relevant.** The codebase already gates well in places
(Platform $250k, IPO/mergers $750k, Delegation by lead) — this pass applies the same idea to the
three worst day-one dumps. Pure presentation gating, no engine/economy/persistence change.
- [x] **Company meta-layer gated behind first ship** (`hasShipped = launched ≥ 1 || legacy > 0`):
      Achievements, Scenarios, Challenges, Device Museum, the Near-milestones card, and the
      $250k Platform-founding GOAL no longer appear on an empty garage. An already-FOUNDED Platform
      entry still always shows; returning prestige founders (legacy > 0) keep the whole layer.
- [x] **Stock Exchange gated** (`showStocks = hasShipped || holds shares`): the Market tab no
      longer opens onto a wall of tradeable rivals + sparklines in week 1. Holdings/portfolio still
      show if somehow held; reappears the moment you ship.
- [x] **Research roadmap de-walled**: project groups render only for eras you've reached (the
      EraRoadmap above already previews what's ahead) instead of stacking every locked future-era
      project card; a single muted "More research projects unlock as you advance eras" hint
      (`.rd__roadmap-hint`, tokenised) replaces them. Component-tech lines were already era-filtered.
- 511 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green. No new tests (presentation-only gating; behaviour covered by
      existing screen render). NOT verified on device: exact thresholds feel — first-ship may be a
      touch early/late for stocks; flag after a playtest (one-line change to the `showStocks` rule).
- Next slices from the audit (not done this pass): the persistent "Next Move" objective spine
      (Tier 0 — biggest "what do I do next" lever), pre-commit synergy/market-fit hints in Design
      Lab, glossary in the launch post-mortem + dedupe the drifting STAT_LABEL maps, build-wait
      clarity, Design-Lab Back/Next during the tutorial.

## v43 — Tier 0: the "Next Move" objective spine (DONE 2026-06-24)
The audit's #1 lever: the first-build Coach hands off at first launch (`tutorialDone`) and the
player falls off a cliff — they know the loop but not what to chase next. This adds a persistent,
ordered ladder of ONE concrete next step at a time, shown high on HQ. Mirrors the achievements
architecture exactly (pure catalog + predicates + "newly satisfied" diff the state layer announces).
- [x] **`engine/objectives.ts`** (pure, +12 tests): a 10-rung ordered ladder — launch → hire →
      second launch → first research project → first hit → reach Era 2 → buy an office upgrade →
      found the Platform division → IPO → reach the pinnacle. Each rung has an imperative label, a
      one-line "why", a deep-link `tab`, a CTA, a Lucide icon name, and a `done(state)` predicate
      that reads only already-tracked state. `currentObjective` returns the first rung that's neither
      latched-complete NOR live-satisfied (so the card advances INSTANTLY after an action, before the
      latch is even written); `satisfiedObjectiveIds` / `newlyCompletedObjectives` for the state diff.
      Engine purity kept — declares its own `ObjectiveTab` union instead of importing the UI `Tab`.
- [x] **State** (`gameState.ts`): `completedObjectives: string[]` (monotonic, resets per company so
      each run re-walks the ladder) + `evaluateObjectives(state)` mirroring `evaluateAndUnlock`.
      Persistence backfills the field AND silently seeds it from the live-satisfied set for old/mid-
      game saves (no toast burst on first load — same pattern as the achievement backfill).
- [x] **Wiring** (`useGame.tsx`): folded into the once-per-week tick announce gate (a gentle
      `confirm` cue + one collapsed "Goal complete — …" toast, deferred so the action's own toast
      lands first); folded SILENTLY into both offline-catch-up paths so a returning player isn't
      toast-spammed for goals cleared while away.
- [x] **HQ `NextMoveCard`**: a premium accent card (glyph chip + "Next move · N of M" eyebrow +
      label + why + deep-link button) shown directly under the era-goal once `tutorialDone`, so the
      first-build Coach owns the very first session and the ladder takes over after. Tokenised CSS
      (`.hq__next*`), hidden when the whole ladder is complete (the StrategicInsightsCard then carries
      ongoing guidance). No double-guidance with the Coach (gated on tutorialDone).
- 523 tests (+12), tsc 0, build+PWA green. NOT verified on device: the card's exact placement feel
      and whether the 10 rungs pace well across a full playthrough (rung set + copy live in one file).

## v44 — Tier 2: readability earlier — glossary in the post-mortem + STAT_LABEL dedupe (DONE 2026-06-24)
Audit finding #7: a player who flops opens the launch post-mortem first and hits undefined jargon;
and the "glossary never drifts" promise was already undercut by THREE copies of the stat-label map
(glossary STAT_INFO, Market.tsx, reviews.ts) that had diverged ("Quality" vs "build quality").
- [x] **Glossary owns both registers** (`engine/glossary.ts`): STAT_INFO gains a `prose` field
      (lowercase sentence form: "build quality", "battery life", …) alongside the Title-Case `label`.
      Single source of truth for stat copy in BOTH registers — they can't drift again.
- [x] **Dedupe**: `engine/reviews.ts` and `screens/Market.tsx` now derive their local STAT_LABEL maps
      from STAT_INFO (`.prose` for review sentences, `.label` for UI) instead of hand-maintained
      literals. Review output is byte-identical (prose values unchanged) — all review tests pass as-is.
- [x] **Shared `StatGlossary`** (`components/StatGlossary.tsx` + `statGlossary.css`): extracted the
      Design Lab's collapsible "what the stats mean" guide into a reusable component (neutral `sg__*`
      classes), and surfaced it in the **launch post-mortem** ("Why it performed") so the five stat
      terms are one tap from a plain-language definition exactly where the player reads why a product
      won or flopped. Design Lab now uses the shared component; its dead `lab__glossary*` CSS removed.
- **Piece B (pre-commit market-fit hint) NOT done — already shipped.** Verified in source: the Design
      Lab live hero already gives the pre-commit signal — a live `Fit /100` pill (`DesignLab.tsx:516`),
      a projected verdict that uses the real launch gate (522), synergy/weak-link notes (524–530),
      competition-drag explanation (539–545), and the wizard shows each segment's "wants" via
      `segmentWantsById` (97). Adding more would clutter the best-disclosed screen for no gain.
- 523 tests, tsc 0, build+PWA green. Pure readability/refactor — no engine/economy/balance change.
- Tier 2 remaining: none material. Tier 3 (first-session smoothness) is next — build-wait clarity +
      Design-Lab Back/Next during the tutorial.
